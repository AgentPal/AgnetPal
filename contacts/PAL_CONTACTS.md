# Pal Contacts

AgentPal starts with Mira as the default Main Pal and seven official bundled owner-capable Pals.

This file and `contacts/pals.json` are part of the AgentPal source of truth for Pal discovery. Individual Pal Packs must not keep their own hard-coded list of other Pals. If collaboration is needed, the current AI / Mira / Brain resolves available collaborators from contacts / registry case-by-case.

Ordinary messages go to Mira. Other Pals do not listen by default; they participate only when Mira routes owned work with a Context Packet or when the user calls them with `/pal Name` or `@Name`.

Replies must start with the speaking Pal name in AgentPal mode. Mira replies start with `Mira：`; direct owner Pal replies start with names such as `Atlas：`, `Rhea：`, or `Nova：`. When Mira summarizes another Pal, she starts with `Mira：` and labels that Pal's advice, for example `Atlas 建议：`.

Default `active_pal` is Mira. When Mira routes owned work to an owner Pal, that Pal becomes the active speaker and handles the task directly. Mira routes and stops; she does not continue doing the owned task after handoff.

## Contact Rule

Only valid Pal Packs can enter this file. Skills, tools, models, MCP servers, plugins, non-Pal runtimes, raw repositories, knowledge packs, and persona packs belong in `imports/` or `registry/`, not in Pal contacts.

Adding, removing, or renaming a Pal should mainly update contacts / registry and public official Pal lists. It should not require editing every existing Pal's professional files.
