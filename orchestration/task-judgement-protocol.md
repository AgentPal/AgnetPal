# Task Judgement Protocol

Task Judgement is the structured evaluation the first Pal, current Main Pal, or owner Pal performs before choosing a work shape.

In AgentPal v0.1.0-rc.1, this is a design aid and optional internal reasoning structure. It does not activate external agents, Subagent Mode, or Deep Conductor workflows.

## Purpose

Task Judgement helps decide whether a task can use a fast owner Pal answer or whether it should be staged, packaged, verified, or reserved for a future multi-step topology.

Deliverable-aware Task Judgement is an AgentPal system-level capability. It is not Mira-only. Mira is the default Main Pal, Leader Pal, and Conductor, but any directly called Pal or current owner Pal must perform deliverable-aware judgement before accepting a complex task as a single-owner task.

The first Pal that receives or decomposes a composite task owns the first decomposition duty. The first Pal is not always Mira. It may be Mira, a directly called Pal, or a current owner Pal. That first Pal must identify the material stages and name selected or provisional stage owner Pals before asking clarification questions, handing off, or letting Runtime execute.

The current Main Pal or owner Pal must identify:

- `domain_focus`: the subject or knowledge domain of the request
- `content_deliverables`: reports, briefs, drafts, specifications, plans, or other content outputs
- `final_deliverables`: the user-visible final artifact or outcome
- `work_stages`: the meaningful stages required to reach the final deliverable
- `capability_needs`: the capability each stage requires
- `selected_stage_owner_pal`: the registered Pal that owns each material stage, a provisional registered owner, or an explicit owner gap
- `verification_needs`: the evidence or review needed before a completion claim

Topic domain is not the same as final deliverable. A research topic may still require an implementation-stage deliverable. A development request may still require research, product, writing, document, system, or quality stages.

Content-stage owner does not equal whole-task owner. If a task contains multiple obvious deliverables or stages, the first Pal / current Main Pal / owner Pal should not compress the whole task into one Pal handoff. It should select stage owner Pals case-by-case, then produce staged candidates or a staged Task Package.

Runtime is never the Pal-layer owner of a material stage. Runtime may be the executor candidate for file edits, commands, search, screenshots, rendering, or publishing actions, but each material stage still needs a Pal-layer owner or an explicit owner gap.

## Allowed Recommended Modes

`recommended_mode` is a candidate judgement input, not a hard rule.

- `fast_route`
- `single_owner`
- `owner_plus_verifier`
- `plan_execute_verify`
- `parallel_independent_review`
- `sequential_chain`
- `best_of_n_runtime`

## v0.1 Active Modes

Active in v0.1.0-rc.1:

- `fast_route`
- `single_owner`
- compact `task_package`
- staged `task_package`

Future design only:

- `owner_plus_verifier` as a separate workflow
- `plan_execute_verify` as an automated workflow
- `parallel_independent_review`
- `sequential_chain`
- `best_of_n_runtime`

## Judgement Principles

- Use current contacts / registry for Pal availability.
- Use capability profiles only as non-binding candidates.
- The first Pal must name selected or provisional stage owner Pals before asking clarification questions.
- Clarifying questions may refine stage scope, but they must not replace first-pass stage owner judgement.
- Do not route by keyword.
- Do not use task/domain -> fixed Pal maps.
- Do not turn capability examples into routes.
- Select a stage owner Pal for each material stage by case-specific judgement; express alternative Pal, Runtime, and Skill options as candidates, not fixed routes.
- Do not name Runtime as the only owner of an implementation-shaped stage.
- The first Pal / current Main Pal / owner Pal must consider the requested final deliverable, not only the topic domain.
- Any current owner Pal must perform deliverable-aware task judgement before accepting a complex task as a single-owner task.
- Do not assume complexity means multiple Pals.
- Do not assume simplicity means Mira should answer.
- Do not assume a directly called specialist owns every stage of a composite task.
- Direct `/pal Name` calls select the current speaking Pal; they do not remove that Pal's duty to identify stages outside its own responsibility.
- Prefer the smallest useful context slice.
- Ask for confirmation before high-risk writes, commands, deletion, publishing, or private-memory writes.

## Owner Pal Duty

Before accepting a complex task as a single-owner task, any current owner Pal must judge:

- whether the task is single-stage or multi-stage
- whether it contains multiple obvious deliverables
- which stages the current Pal is suited to own
- which stages need other Pal / Runtime / Skill candidates
- whether Mira should remain or resume the upper-level Conductor role
- whether a verification stage is needed
- whether the correct v0.1 output is a staged Task Package

If the task contains an implementation-stage deliverable, the owner Pal must not say that the Runtime will simply handle that stage after a content Pal finishes. The implementation stage needs a selected Pal-layer owner or an explicit owner gap first; the current Runtime may execute only with evidence and within its permissions.

For the bundled v0.1 Pal pool, Atlas is the registered development Pal. If the final deliverable includes an HTML page, static webpage, frontend implementation, code artifact, or repository implementation task, the implementation stage should name Atlas as the selected stage owner unless current contacts / registry and user constraints justify another registered owner. This is capability-based stage ownership, not `HTML -> Atlas` keyword routing.

## First Pal Decomposition Duty

The first Pal's visible response for a composite task should include:

1. a short statement that the task is composite
2. content deliverable stages and their selected or provisional stage owner Pals
3. final deliverable stages and their selected or provisional stage owner Pals
4. verification stage and verifier candidate when useful
5. Runtime / Skill executor candidates, clearly separated from Pal owners
6. focused clarification questions, only after the provisional stage owner list

Invalid first responses:

- asking only clarifying questions without naming stage owner Pals
- naming only one content Pal and leaving final deliverable ownership undefined
- saying the current Runtime will handle a page / code / UI / HTML implementation stage without a Pal owner
- saying a later Pal will decide all stage owners

## Hardcoded Routing Boundary

Allowed:

- "candidate content-stage owner"
- "candidate implementation-stage owner"
- "candidate verifier"
- "candidate Runtime / Skill"
- case-specific reasoning from user goal, deliverables, available Pals, available runtime, context, and risk

Forbidden as current rules:

- keyword trigger
- fixed route
- task/domain -> Pal table
- "must route"
- "always handoff"
- statements that a particular artifact type always belongs to a particular Pal

Negative examples may mention forbidden route shapes only to prevent regressions.

## Output

For ordinary user answers, Task Judgement usually stays internal.

For audits, debugging, or PalBench, it may be written as `templates/orchestration/task-judgement-packet.md`.
