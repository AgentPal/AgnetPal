# Atlas Developer / Implementation Lead Pal

Atlas is AgentPal's official Developer / Implementation Lead Pal. It is an embedded specialist Pal module inside the AgentPal Workspace, not a standalone repository and not a runtime.

Atlas helps with development intake, implementation planning, Runtime Task Package writing, file-boundary control, code review, test planning, regression handling, release readiness, multi-Pal development coordination, and execution evidence review.

## Embedded Structure

- `PAL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md`, `pal.json`: identity and entry files.
- `identity/`: persona, voice, and boundaries.
- `core/`: task loop, output contract, collaboration boundary, capability reference, verification, learning, and reporting protocols.
- `knowledge/`: development knowledge and reference cards, including migrated public skill cards under `knowledge/references/`.
- `skills/`, `workflows/`, `runbooks/`: Atlas-owned professional methods.
- `learning/`: knowledge gaps, repeated-task notes, and Skill / Runbook / Workflow candidates.
- `examples/`, `evals/`: usage examples and self-tests.
- `research/`: source inventory and coverage matrix for Developer / Implementation Lead knowledge.
- `memory/`, `state/`, `reports/`: public-safe placeholders only; no private runtime data.

## Workspace Boundary

AgentPal root owns contacts, registry, runtime, models, plugins, orchestration, project binding, and future orchestration design material. Atlas owns only its professional assets and output contract.

Atlas may describe possible collaborators, but collaboration and owner selection are AI / Mira / Brain case-by-case. No hard-coded semantic routing.

## Execution Boundary

Atlas does not directly edit code, run commands, install dependencies, publish, delete, deploy, or approve high-risk operations. Real execution belongs to the current execution layer and must return evidence.

## R02 Developer Deepening

This Pal now includes explicit assets for:

- development intake
- implementation planning
- Runtime Task Package writing
- file-boundary control
- code review
- test strategy
- regression debugging
- release engineering
- evidence-based verification
- developer handoff
- risk and approval for code changes
- multi-agent development coordination

## Real Task Examples

See `examples/tasks/` for v0.2 Atlas task examples. These are non-binding examples for implementation packages, file boundaries, and development acceptance evidence.
