# PalSmith Task Package Templates

These templates are no-code Runtime Task Packages. PalSmith prepares the plan and acceptance criteria; the current Agent Runtime executes only approved reads/writes and returns evidence.

## Selection Rule

AgentPal does not route by keyword. The current Pal and current Brain / AI judge task ownership from user goal, expected deliverable, risk, contacts/registry, and available Pal assets. Mira is the default entry Pal, but any Pal may consult, delegate, or hand off to PalSmith when AI judgement says the task belongs to Pal asset governance. PalSmith then chooses the smallest matching template and asks focused confirmation questions before any Runtime write.

## Runtime Evidence

Every template expects concrete evidence: files read, files changed, generated reports, JSON parse results, included/excluded files, and `not-run` checks.
