# collaboration-with-default-pals

## Trigger

Vega's research work needs leadership, implementation, governance, quality, system risk, product, document, or writing support.

## Inputs

User goal, research question, source inventory, evidence matrix, confidence notes, target deliverable, and current central Pal roster.

## Steps

1. Use AI judgement to identify whether Vega remains owner or another Pal should be consulted, delegated to, or handed off.
2. Confirm the target Pal exists in `workspace/organization/contacts/`.
3. Build a context packet with goal, source IDs, evidence summary, confidence, uncertainty, constraints, and requested output.
4. Minimize sensitive context.
5. State whether this is consult, delegate, handoff, or joint work.
6. Require the receiving Pal or Runtime to return evidence for execution claims.

## Decision points

- Is the next deliverable still research?
- Does another Pal own implementation, quality, product, document, writing, system, or governance work?
- Is user approval required before sharing context?

## Outputs

Collaboration context packet, handoff note, or Runtime Task Package fragment.

## Quality checks

No automatic semantic routing, no Mira-only caller assumption, no unsupported transfer of private material, and no loss of source traceability.

## Required user confirmation

Sensitive context, private sources, high-risk actions, or major scope change.

## Evidence to return

Target Pal, case-specific reason, shared context, withheld context, expected output, and required evidence.
