# Compatibility Notes

The v0.4/v0.5 foundation pass keeps compatibility conservative.

- Official Pal Pack directories moved to `official/pals/`.
- Root `pals/` moved to `archive/migration-from-v0.3/root-legacy/pals/`.
- Root `contacts/` moved to `archive/migration-from-v0.3/root-legacy/contacts/`.
- Root `registry/` moved to `workspace/resources/registry/`.
- The active roster is `workspace/organization/contacts/`.
- Root release files remain in place while `release/current/` provides current pointers.
- External project bindings should use new thin templates, but older bound projects can be upgraded in place.
- `projects/project-workgroup-template/agentpal/` is now a compatibility pointer. Its old thick prompt files moved to `archive/migration-from-v0.3/legacy-project-workgroup-template/`.
- Historical official Pal reports/state moved to `archive/migration-from-v0.3/official-pal-history/` so public Pal assets remain clean in fresh clones.

R69 classifies remaining old references instead of treating every archived example as active runtime guidance.
