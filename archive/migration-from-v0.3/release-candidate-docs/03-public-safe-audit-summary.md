# Public-Safe Audit Summary

The v0.1.0-rc.1 public-safe audit is a release-readiness summary, not an absolute safety guarantee.

The detailed audit record is maintained at [release/v0.1.0-rc.1/public-safe-audit.md](../../../release/v0.1.0-rc.1/public-safe-audit.md).

## What Was Checked

The audit reviewed release-facing Markdown and JSON areas, including:

- root release files
- public documentation
- official Pal Pack structure and boundary files
- contacts and registry
- memory, state, and report boundaries
- examples, evals, templates, prompts, imports, and release-facing files

## Summary Finding

The audit did not identify obvious real secrets, credentials, private keys, customer data, or local maintainer paths in the scanned release text.

Keyword hits for sensitive terms were mainly boundary language explaining what must not be published. Future-feature references were reviewed as limitations, future design, or negative-boundary language rather than active v0.1.0-rc.1 claims.

## Remaining Risks

- The audit was heuristic text review plus manual inspection, not a formal secrets-scanning certification.
- Binary files, generated archives, and manually assembled packages require separate review.
- Ignored local runtime files must not be manually included in release archives.
- Memory-like files are high-risk by category and should be reviewed before each release.
- Future design materials must remain clearly marked as inactive for v0.1.0-rc.1.

## Release Recommendation

The audit supports a conditional public-safe readiness statement for v0.1.0-rc.1. It does not support a claim of absolute safety.
