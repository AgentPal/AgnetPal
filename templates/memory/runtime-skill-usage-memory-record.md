# Runtime Skill Usage Memory Record

This template records observed use of a host Runtime Skill, plugin, MCP tool, or similar capability.

The Skill belongs to the host Runtime. A Pal may record usage experience, but the Pal does not own, install, or execute the Skill.

## Rules

- Record current evidence, not assumptions.
- Do not treat previous Skill availability as proof that the current Runtime has the Skill.
- Do not put Runtime-installed Skills under Pal-owned Skills.
- Keep future use as `candidate` guidance only.
