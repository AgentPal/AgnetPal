## Rules

- `topology_selected` is a current judgement, not a permanent route.
- `runtime_skill_candidates` require current host Runtime evidence.
- `memory_used` must not expose private content.
- `cross_runtime_continuation` does not make the current Runtime a fixed route.
- Memory summaries are judgement inputs, not proof of current Runtime capability.
- `context_budget` must not reduce verification quality.
- `user_explanation` must say when no execution has happened.
