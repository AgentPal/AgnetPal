# Conductor Decision Record

Use this record to explain why a Deep Conductor or Project Conductor plan chose its topology, Pal candidates, Runtime candidates, Skill candidates, context budget, and verification plan.

## Rules

- The record is a judgement trace, not a route table.
- Current Runtime evidence must be separated from memory.
- Cross-runtime memory preserves continuity but does not prove the current Runtime has the same tools, Skills, or permissions.
- Runtime Skill Usage Memory records host Runtime experience. It must not be recorded as a Pal-owned Skill.
- Token / cost notes are qualitative unless the host Runtime provides exact metering.
- Model and reasoning candidates are not automatic selectors.
- Verification cost is necessary quality cost; missing evidence must remain visible.
- Private project facts, secrets, local absolute paths, and raw chat history must not be written into public records.
