## Rules

- The record is a judgement trace, not a route table.
- Current Runtime evidence must be separated from memory.
- Cross-runtime memory preserves continuity but does not prove the current Runtime has the same tools, Skills, or permissions.
- Runtime Skill Usage Memory records host Runtime experience. It must not be recorded as a Pal-owned Skill.
- Private project facts, secrets, local absolute paths, and raw chat history must not be written into public records.
