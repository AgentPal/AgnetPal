# Project Conductor Task Map

This template turns a project-level goal into a no-code project map that a host Runtime can use to plan the next round.

The task map is not an automatic execution plan. It does not start tasks, run commands, call external Agents, or create a background project system.

## Field Rules

- `owner_pal_candidates` are case-specific candidates, not fixed routes.
- `runtime_skill_candidates` are host Runtime Skill / Plugin / MCP candidates.
- `pal_owned_skills_used` are Pal methods, workflows, runbooks, or output contracts.
- `runtime_candidates` are execution-layer candidates, not Pal-layer owners.
- `routing_memory_candidates` are possible future evidence, not route rules.
- `memory_context` is bounded summary context, not raw private history.
- `cross_runtime_continuation` preserves continuity but does not prove the current Runtime has the previous Runtime's capabilities.
