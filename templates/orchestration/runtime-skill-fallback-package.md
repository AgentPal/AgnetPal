# Runtime Skill Fallback Package

Use this package when a Runtime Skill, plugin, or MCP candidate is unavailable, fails, returns untrusted output, or cannot be used safely.

what_to_do_if_skill_missing:
  - "Report unavailable or unknown explicitly."
  - "Use ordinary Runtime Task Package if the task can still be completed safely."
  - "Ask the user whether to install/enable a Skill or choose another Runtime when the Skill is essential."
what_to_do_if_skill_execution_fails:
  - "Preserve the failure message or evidence summary."
  - "Do not retry outside the approved scope."
  - "Return a repair or alternate execution package."
what_to_do_if_output_untrusted:
  - "Route output through Pal verification."
  - "Require source, artifact, diff, screenshot, test, or inspection evidence as appropriate."
  - "Mark result partial, fail, blocked, or not-run if evidence is insufficient."
ordinary_task_package_fallback:
  allowed: true
  conditions:
    - "The task can be completed with normal Runtime reads/writes/tools."
    - "Privacy and file boundaries remain valid."

  fields:
    - candidate
    - failure_or_unavailable_reason
    - fallback_used

stop_conditions:
  - "The missing capability is essential and no safe fallback exists."
  - "The host Runtime cannot provide evidence for availability or output."

```

Fallback results must keep failure visible. Do not turn unavailable, failed, or unverified Runtime Skill use into a pass.
