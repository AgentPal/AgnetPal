# Capability Inventory Templates

This directory contains reusable JSON templates for Capability Inventory profiles.

It is a template source only. It is not a facts source, not an automatic runtime scan result, and not a routing table.

When creating a real profile, copy a template and follow `docs/03-user-guides/manual-capability-profile.md`. Fill only confirmed information and use `unknown` for unconfirmed fields.

External project bindings should not copy this directory. Bound projects keep a thin `.agentpal/` pointer and store project-specific capability inventory under the central `workspace/projects/<project-id>/capability-inventory/` record when approved.

Business System profiles describe external system capability and governance boundaries only. They are not connectors, API clients, permission grants, credential stores, automatic scanners, background sync jobs, release tools, or automatic write access.

Capability Inventory profiles are AI judgement inputs. They must not become `keyword_map`, `domain_map`, `role_map`, or any deterministic semantic route. Do not store credentials, private tokens, API keys, cookies, passwords, or secrets in copied profiles.
