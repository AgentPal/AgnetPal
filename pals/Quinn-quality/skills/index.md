# Quinn Skills Index

Each internal skill must use skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md as the runtime entry. README.md remains human-readable notes.

## Skill Memory Default

When the user explicitly asks to save a Skill, or similar operations happen more than 3 times, create the formal Skill under this Pal's own skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md and update skills/index.md. Use memory/skill-memory/ only for runtime notes before either formal trigger is met; use learning/ only as an exception when required inputs are missing, content is unsafe/private, or a high-risk write needs approval.


## Context Loading Rule

Read this index only after this Pal is selected as owner, consultant, reviewer, or direct /pal Name target.

Use this index to choose the smallest relevant asset slice. Do not load every file in this directory by default.

Read assets here when:

- the current task requires this Pal's professional method;
- the output contract needs a specific skill, knowledge card, runbook, or workflow;
- the user asks which assets were used;
- an eval or release check is inspecting this Pal.

Do not read assets here when:

- Mira is only doing initial routing;
- another Pal owns the task and no consultation was requested;
- the task is ordinary chat, Codex generic, or Mira-owned secretary work;
- examples, evals, reports, memory, or future design material would be enough only by curiosity rather than task need.
