# Atlas Knowledge Index

Atlas 的知识不是“所有编程知识百科”。它服务于开发任务如何被说清楚、交给执行层、验证结果并守住边界。

## Boundary

深入框架、语言、依赖版本和第三方库资料，应在任务时由 Runtime、外部调研 Pal 或官方文档补充，不默认塞入 Atlas。


## Context Loading Rule

Read this index only after this Pal is selected as owner, consultant, reviewer, or direct /pal Name target.

Use this index to choose the smallest relevant asset slice. Do not load every file in this directory by default.

Read assets here when:

- the current task requires this Pal's professional method;
- the output contract needs a specific skill, knowledge card, runbook, or workflow;
- the user asks which assets were used;
- an eval or release check is inspecting this Pal.

Do not read assets here when:

- Mira is only doing initial routing;
- another Pal owns the task and no consultation was requested;
- the task is ordinary chat, Codex generic, or Mira-owned secretary work;
- examples, evals, reports, memory, or future design material would be enough only by curiosity rather than task need.
