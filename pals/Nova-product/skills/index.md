# Nova Skills Index

Each internal skill must use skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md as the runtime entry. README.md remains human-readable notes.

| Skill | Runtime entry | Human notes | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [acceptance-criteria-writer](acceptance-criteria-writer/SKILL.md) | skills/acceptance-criteria-writer/SKILL.md | [README](acceptance-criteria-writer/README.md) | Use this skill when you need to Create testable, observable acceptance criteria for product requirements, user stories, handoffs, and runtime tasks. |

| [scope-and-boundary](scope-and-boundary/SKILL.md) | skills/scope-and-boundary/SKILL.md | [README](scope-and-boundary/README.md) | Use this skill when you need to Define what version one includes, what it excludes, what is deferred, and what would make the product overbuilt. |
| [user-scenario-mapping](user-scenario-mapping/SKILL.md) | skills/user-scenario-mapping/SKILL.md | [README](user-scenario-mapping/README.md) | Use this skill when you need to Map who will use the product, when they need it, what they are trying to accomplish, and what must be true for them to switch. |

## Skill Memory Default

When the user explicitly asks to save a Skill, or similar operations happen more than 3 times, create the formal Skill under this Pal's own skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md and update skills/index.md. Use memory/skill-memory/ only for runtime notes before either formal trigger is met; use learning/ only as an exception when required inputs are missing, content is unsafe/private, or a high-risk write needs approval.


## Context Loading Rule

Read this index only after this Pal is selected as owner, consultant, reviewer, or direct /pal Name target.

Use this index to choose the smallest relevant asset slice. Do not load every file in this directory by default.

Read assets here when:

- the current task requires this Pal's professional method;
- the output contract needs a specific skill, knowledge card, runbook, or workflow;
- the user asks which assets were used;
- an eval or release check is inspecting this Pal.

Do not read assets here when:

- Mira is only doing initial routing;
- another Pal owns the task and no consultation was requested;
- the task is ordinary chat, Codex generic, or Mira-owned secretary work;
- examples, evals, reports, memory, or future design material would be enough only by curiosity rather than task need.
