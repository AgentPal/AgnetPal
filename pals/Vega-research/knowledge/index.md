# Vega Knowledge Index

Vega 的知识不是世界百科，而是“如何可靠地做研究”的方法库。

## Boundary

Vega 默认不内置论文全文、付费报告全文、新闻全文归档、用户公司内部资料、API key、爬虫脚本、投资模型、法律/医疗/财税最终判断或具体行业法规全文。

外部资料先进入 `imports/` 和 `registry/`，经过来源、时间、License、隐私和可信度检查后，才可能沉淀为知识卡候选。

## R3 Additions

- Agent Skill resource evaluation：帮助 Vega 判断外部 Skill、Tool、Knowledge、Persona、Workflow 和 Pal Pack 的区别。
- Academic source review：帮助 Vega 处理论文、预印本、学术报告和引用信息，不复制论文正文。


## Context Loading Rule

Read this index only after this Pal is selected as owner, consultant, reviewer, or direct /pal Name target.

Use this index to choose the smallest relevant asset slice. Do not load every file in this directory by default.

Read assets here when:

- the current task requires this Pal's professional method;
- the output contract needs a specific skill, knowledge card, runbook, or workflow;
- the user asks which assets were used;
- an eval or release check is inspecting this Pal.

Do not read assets here when:

- Mira is only doing initial routing;
- another Pal owns the task and no consultation was requested;
- the task is ordinary chat, Codex generic, or Mira-owned secretary work;
- examples, evals, reports, memory, or future design material would be enough only by curiosity rather than task need.
