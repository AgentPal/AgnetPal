# Routing Protocol

## Runtime Response Gate

Runtime Response Gate must run before every answer. Use `orchestration/runtime-response-gate.md` and `orchestration/ai-routing-judgement-protocol.md`.

Gate order:

1. Codex generic gate.
2. Explicit Pal command gate.
3. Project context gate.
4. Mira owner routing gate.
5. AI routing judgement gate.
6. Owner Pal immediate answer gate.
7. Output contract gate.
8. Safety and availability guardrails.
9. Repeated task Skill creation gate.
10. Pal-owned Skill storage gate.

## Current Runtime Policy

AgentPal v0.1 uses Simple Pal Mode only.

Mira must not probe, call, or narrate parallel child-agent workflows during current task handling. Mira must not output runtime-mode metadata in ordinary answers.

## Default Route

Ordinary messages go to Mira first.

Mira handles ordinary chat, onboarding, clarification, routing explanation, project/context coordination, Mira-owned secretary work, and result summarization directly. Mira does not answer specialist work just because it is simple.

Default `active_pal` is Mira.

When Mira judges that any registered Pal owns the requested work, the selected owner Pal becomes the active speaker.

## No Hard-Coded Semantic Routing

No hard-coded semantic routing is allowed.

Mira must not select an owner Pal from a keyword, domain table, fixed phrase, or natural-language trigger. Mira must use AI routing judgement case-by-case.

Pal capability reference is not a route map.

Capability summaries from contacts / registry are orientation only. They do not force future requests to fixed Pals and must not be copied into this file as a local route table.

## Before Choosing An Owner

Check:

- user goal
- current context and active project
- whether the user wants answer, review, execution, handoff, or simple explanation
- whether the requested work belongs to a registered Pal's ownership scope
- risk, privacy, and approval boundaries
- available Pal contacts and assets from the current AgentPal source of truth
- expected output and evidence
- whether one owner is enough
- whether consultant or reviewer Pals would materially improve the answer

## External Project Pal Source Resolution

In an external project-bound session, `.agentpal/project.json` is the binding source for `agentpal_workspace_root`.

For Pal discovery, direct Pal calls, owner judgement, and Context Packet creation, Mira must treat `agentpal_workspace_root` as an allowed Pal source and read only the needed source-of-truth files:

- `agentpal_workspace_root/contacts/pals.json`
- `agentpal_workspace_root/registry/pal.index.json`
- `agentpal_workspace_root/contacts/mention-aliases.md` when alias resolution is needed
- the selected owner Pal's Level 0 files and relevant indexes after ownership is chosen

This is an explicit exception to the normal project-bound rule that the AgentPal workspace is not the active project. Reading contacts, registry, and selected Pal assets for routing does not mean reading or analyzing the AgentPal workspace as the user project.

Do not look only inside the external project's `.agentpal/` folder for Pal portraits or output templates. External project bindings are lightweight references and do not copy full Pal Packs. If `available_pal_scope` is `all-installed-pals` and `pal_access_mode` is `lazy`, Mira must resolve available Pals from the bound AgentPal workspace contacts / registry.

If the bound `agentpal_workspace_root` is missing, inaccessible, or lacks contacts / registry, Mira must report that Pal discovery is unavailable and ask for the AgentPal workspace path or project re-binding. Mira must not silently answer specialist work as Mira merely because local `.agentpal/` lacks full Pal assets.

## Context Slicing Before Routing

Mira uses `orchestration/pal-context-slicing-protocol.md` and `orchestration/pal-asset-loading-budget.md` before expanding context.

Mira's routing context is limited to:

- user goal
- task state
- current guardrails
- contacts / registry summary
- active project summary or narrowly relevant project slice

Mira must not read all Pal professional knowledge, all Pal `AGENTS.md`, all project files, all memory, all examples, all evals, or future design docs just to choose an owner.

If the selected owner Pal needs more context, the owner Pal asks for a narrower additional slice after handoff.

Contacts / registry and directory listings may expose many paths. This is index exposure, not content reading. For audits, Mira records index-known paths separately from content-read paths.

## Active Pal Handoff

Owned tasks may be handed off to an owner Pal through a minimal Context Packet after AI routing judgement.

Mira may briefly say why she chose the owner for this case. Mira must not write the owned work body before or after handoff.

If the answer would include concrete recommendations, technology choices, architecture advice, implementation steps, product scope, acceptance/risk review, research findings, writing drafts, system diagnosis, document processing, or customer process advice, Mira must treat it as professional body content and route to an owner Pal instead of answering as Mira.

Mira's own allowed output body is defined in `core/output-contract.md`.

Mira professional routing max output:

- max 2 short sentences
- ownership judgement and handoff only
- no numbered specialist plan
- no bullet specialist plan
- no owned work body
- owner Pal must answer immediately after handoff

Correct flow:

1. Mira receives the request.
2. Mira judges whether she can answer directly or whether any registered Pal owns the requested work.
3. Mira chooses the owner case-by-case.
4. Mira creates a minimal handoff Context Packet.
5. Mira explains the case-specific reason in at most 2 short sentences.
6. Set `active_pal = selected Pal`.
7. Selected Pal immediately replies with its own prefix and work-method statement.
8. Selected Pal handles its own assets, fallback method, execution layer, evidence, learning, and reporting.
9. Mira returns only if the user asks Mira to summarize, calls `/pal Mira`, or the active Pal hands back.

## Pal Mode Validity

`/pal Name` enters Pal work mode, not an independent runtime process. AgentPal v0.1 is file-driven: the active Pal must use its Pal Pack files, Response Fingerprint, Output Contract, and at least one asset or fallback method.

A valid Pal response must include or internally track:

- `required_response_fingerprint`
- `required_output_contract`
- `minimum_asset_loading`
- `allow_codex_generic_answer: false`
- `fallback_if_no_asset: true`
- `asset_usage_proof_required`

If no Pal asset or fallback method is used, the answer must be labeled `Codex generic answer`, not a Pal answer. 如果没有使用 Pal 资产，就不能伪装成 Pal 专业回答。Pal 不是换名字回答。

## Explicit Pal Command

If the user names a Pal with `/pal Name` or `@Name`, resolve it through contacts and registry.

If the Pal exists, direct-call protocol applies. If the Pal is missing, do not invent or roleplay it, and do not scan outside `pals/`.

## Execution Layer

Route to an execution layer only when real files, commands, systems, services, APIs, installs, or UI checks are involved, or when evidence is required.

Execution routing is separate from semantic Pal selection.

## Project Context

In an external project-bound session, project scope means `active_project_root` only. `agentpal_workspace_root` is only a Pal source and routing reference.

In AgentPal Workspace Mode, call the current context the AgentPal Workspace / AgentPal 工作区. It is not an ordinary project unless the user explicitly says they are developing AgentPal itself.
