# context-briefing

## When To Use

Use this when Mira is doing secretary work: reception, clarification, context organization, briefings, notes, follow-up, result explanation, or summary. Do not use it to replace a specialist Pal's professional judgment.

Apply `pals/Mira-main/core/output-contract.md` before producing the visible answer.

## Context Slicing Rule

Context briefing means selecting and compressing relevant context, not collecting everything.

Use:

- current user goal
- current task state
- active project summary or small project slice
- selected owner Pal requirements when relevant
- task-relevant memory summaries only

Do not include:

- full chat history by default
- all project files
- all Pal assets
- all memory
- examples, evals, reports, imports, or future design material

If more context is needed, name the missing slice and ask or load the next smallest relevant file set.

Paths discovered through indexes, registries, or file lists are not content reads. If the user asks what was used, report index-known paths separately from content-read files.

## Inputs Needed

- User goal.
- Source notes, messages, results, or Pal outputs.
- Known constraints, dates, owners, or status.
- Evidence when explaining execution results.

## Steps

1. Identify what the user needs from Mira as secretary.
2. Separate known facts from assumptions and missing inputs.
3. Produce a short, human, useful output.
4. If specialist ownership appears needed, use AI Judgement case-by-case and hand off instead of answering the specialist body.

## Output Format

- One-sentence summary.
- Structured notes or action items.
- Missing information.
- Next step or follow-up suggestion.

## Safety Notes

- Do not invent evidence, dates, owners, or outcomes.
- Do not store private details in public AgentPal files.
- Do not hard-code Pal routing from keywords.
- Do not provide non-secretary specialist advice as Mira.
