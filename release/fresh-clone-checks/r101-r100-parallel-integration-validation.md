# R101 R100 Parallel Integration Validation

Date: 2026-06-28

## Scope

This validation records local checks for R101, which integrates R100-A/B/C/D
Pal Metadata v0.5 preparation outputs into shared navigation and freezes the
next official Pal upgrade gate.

R101 does not push, pull, fetch, tag, create a GitHub Release, modify official
Pals, modify central contacts, or generate real official `asset-manifest.json`
files.

## Results

Result: pass.

## Worktree Status

Command:

```text
git status --short --branch
```

Result summary:

- branch: `master...origin/master [ahead 35]`
- modified shared entries: `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `RESOURCE_INDEX.md`,
  `agentpal.json`
- modified user guides / roadmap:
  `docs/03-user-guides/official-pal-asset-upgrade-plan.md`,
  `docs/03-user-guides/palsmith-v0.5-pal-creation-and-upgrade.md`,
  `docs/09-roadmap/v0.5-local-development-scope.md`
- new R101 public files:
  `docs/00-overview/pal-metadata-v0.5-upgrade-path.md`,
  `evals/palbench/pal-asset/r101-pal-metadata-v0.5-integration-boundary.md`,
  `release/fresh-clone-checks/r101-r100-parallel-integration-validation.md`,
  `release/integration-notes/r101-next-official-pal-index-backfill-candidate.md`,
  `release/integration-notes/r101-official-pal-upgrade-gate-freeze.md`

No `official/pals/**` or `workspace/organization/contacts/**` diff was present.

## Required File Presence

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| R100-A/B/C/D required public assets missing | 0 |
| R101 required public assets missing | 0 |
| R100 untracked leftover files | 0 |

The R101 validation filename includes `r100` because it validates R100 parallel
integration. It was not counted as an R100 leftover.

## JSON And Pal Integrity

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| visible JSON files parsed | 89 |
| visible JSON parse failures | 0 |
| schema JSON parse failures | 0 |
| Pal asset template JSON parse failures | 0 |
| central registered Pals | 9 |
| central active Pals | 9 |
| official Pal directories | 9 |
| official Pal `pal.json` parse failures | 0 |
| official `asset-manifest.json` count | 0 |
| `routing_policy` | `ai_judgement_only` |
| central `keyword_routing_allowed` | `false` |
| `agentpal.json` Pal Metadata `keyword_routing_allowed` | `false` |

The official `asset-manifest.json` count remains 0 by design. R101 did not
generate real official manifests.

## Boundary Search Classification

Broad boundary-term searches were run for:

- external project `.agentpal/` thick-binding paths;
- `keyword_map|domain_map|role_map`;
- hard-coded Pal/domain routing examples;
- scanner / validator / daemon / auto-scan terms;
- connector / marketplace / installer / credential terms;
- private development-directory string leakage.

Classification:

- broad hits were expected in standards, evals, templates, negative examples,
  and boundary text;
- active route-map declarations: 0;
- secret assignment-like values: 0;
- changed program or dependency files: 0;
- private development-directory string hits in public shared entries: 0;
- public clean-copy external `.agentpal/` thick-binding directories: 0.

Existing allowed examples / templates include:

- failure examples that deliberately contain forbidden positive configuration;
- orchestration templates that contain `no_auto_execution: true`;
- validation files that quote forbidden strings as checks.

These are boundary examples, not active runtime configuration.

## Local Clean-Copy Check

Method:

- created a local temporary copy with `robocopy`;
- excluded `.git`, local `.agentpal`, `node_modules`, and `.venv`;
- ran checks inside the copied tree only;
- removed the temporary copy after checks.

Results:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| required R101 paths missing | 0 |
| required R100 sample paths missing | 0 |
| clean-copy JSON files parsed | 62 |
| clean-copy JSON parse failures | 0 |
| central registered / active Pals | 9 / 9 |
| official Pal directories | 9 |
| official Pal `pal.json` parse failures | 0 |
| clean-copy `routing_policy` | `ai_judgement_only` |
| clean-copy `keyword_routing_allowed` | `false` |
| clean-copy Pal Metadata `keyword_routing_allowed` | `false` |
| active route-map declarations | 0 |
| secret assignment-like values | 0 |
| private development-directory string hits | 0 |
| program / dependency files | 0 |
| external `.agentpal/` thick-binding directories | 0 |

## Not Performed

R101 did not perform:

- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git fetch`
- tag creation or modification
- GitHub Release creation or modification
- release/tag migration
- official Pal metadata edits
- central roster edits
- real official `asset-manifest.json` generation
- scanner, validator program, daemon, connector, installer, marketplace, hub,
  auto-sync, or auto-execution additions
