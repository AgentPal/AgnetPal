# R106-D Local Official Pal Skills Index Gate Validation

Date: 2026-06-28

## Summary

Decision: pass for the local R106-D gate assets, with other-thread R106 files present and intentionally not processed.

Scope: R106-D creates an integration gate, checklist, and issue template for a later R107 integration round. It does not modify official Pal assets, central contacts, shared entry files, or external project bindings.

Execution layer: current Codex local shell in `J:\开发\AgentPal`.

## Files Expected

- `evals/palbench/pal-asset/r106d-official-pal-skills-index-integration-gate.md`
- `release/integration-notes/r106d-official-pal-skills-index-integration-checklist.md`
- `release/integration-notes/r106d-official-pal-skills-index-issue-template.md`
- `release/fresh-clone-checks/r106d-local-official-pal-skills-index-gate-validation.md`

## Required Checks

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| integration gate exists | pass |
| integration checklist exists | pass |
| issue template exists | pass |
| validation file exists | pass |
| central roster parses | pass |
| central roster registered / active count | pass: registered 9, active 9 |
| central roster no keyword routing | pass: `routing_policy` is `ai_judgement_only`, `keyword_routing_allowed` is `false` |
| official Pal dirs count | pass: 9 |
| all official Pal `pal.json` parse | pass: 9 / 9 parse |
| no official Pal diff | note: current worktree has other-thread official Pal skills index diffs; R106-D did not read, modify, stage, or commit them |
| no central contacts diff | pass: 0 diffs under `workspace/organization/contacts/**` |
| no shared entry diff | pass: 0 diffs to `README.md`, `RESOURCE_INDEX.md`, or `agentpal.json` |
| no active keyword routing in R106-D files | pass: 0 exact route-map declarations |
| no concrete credentials in R106-D files | pass: 0 concrete credential patterns |
| no connector / scanner / marketplace program in R106-D files | pass: documentation-only; prohibited behavior is named only as a gate failure condition |
| no code or dependency manifests in R106-D files | pass: 0 |
| no other untracked R106 files | note: other-thread R106 files present; not processed, staged, or committed by R106-D |
| `git diff --check` for R106-D files | pass |

## Local Evidence Snapshot

| Evidence | Value |
| --- | --- |
| R106-D files present | 4 / 4 |
| central registered / active Pals | 9 / 9 |
| official Pal directories | 9 |
| official Pal `pal.json` parse failures | 0 |
| central contacts diff count | 0 |
| shared entry diff count | 0 |
| exact route-map declaration count in R106-D files | 0 |
| concrete credential pattern count in R106-D files | 0 |
| code / dependency manifest additions in R106-D files | 0 |
| `git diff --check` for R106-D files | pass |

## Not-Run Register

- No R106-A/B/C final outputs were validated by this thread.

- No clean-copy integration run was performed.
- No official Pal asset was modified.
- No official Pal `pal.json` was modified.
- No real official `asset-manifest.json` was generated.
- No Agent Skill was copied into Pal `skills/`.
- No report body was copied into memory.
- No raw research was promoted directly to knowledge.
- No external project binding was installed or modified.

## Boundary

This validation record is local evidence for the R106-D documentation-only thread. It is not the R107 integration result and must not be used to claim that R106-A/B/C outputs have passed.
