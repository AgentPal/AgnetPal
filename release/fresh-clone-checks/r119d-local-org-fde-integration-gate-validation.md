# R119-D Local Org Pack / FDE Pack Integration Gate Validation

Date: 2026-06-28

## Summary

Decision: pass for the local R119-D gate assets, with other-thread R119 files present and intentionally not processed.

Scope: R119-D creates an integration gate, checklist, issue template, and R120 integration plan. It does not modify Org Pack / FDE Pack / asset-boundary standard bodies, official Pal assets, central contacts, shared entry files, or external project bindings.

Execution layer: current Codex local shell in `J:\开发\AgentPal`.

## Files Expected

- `evals/palbench/org-pack/r119d-org-fde-integration-gate.md`
- `release/fresh-clone-checks/r119d-local-org-fde-integration-gate-validation.md`
- `release/integration-notes/r119d-org-fde-integration-checklist.md`
- `release/integration-notes/r119d-org-fde-integration-issue-template.md`
- `release/integration-notes/r119d-r120-integration-plan.md`

## Required Checks

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| integration gate exists | pass |
| checklist exists | pass |
| issue template exists | pass |
| R120 integration plan exists | pass |
| validation file exists | pass |
| central roster parses | pass |
| central roster registered / active count | pass: registered 9, active 9 |
| central roster no keyword routing | pass: `routing_policy` is `ai_judgement_only`, `keyword_routing_allowed` is `false` |
| official Pal dirs count | pass: 9 |
| all official Pal `pal.json` parse | pass: 9 / 9 parse |
| no official Pal diff by R119-D | pass: 0 diffs under `official/pals/**` |
| no central contacts diff | pass: 0 diffs under `workspace/organization/contacts/**` |
| no shared entry diff | pass: 0 diffs to `README.md`, `RESOURCE_INDEX.md`, or `agentpal.json` |
| no standards body diff by R119-D | pass: R119-D did not modify `standards/org-pack/**`, `standards/fde-pack/**`, or `standards/asset-boundary/**` |
| no active keyword routing in R119-D files | pass: 0 exact route-map declarations |
| no concrete credentials in R119-D files | pass: 0 concrete credential patterns |
| no connector / scanner / marketplace program in R119-D files | pass: documentation-only; prohibited behavior is named only as a gate failure condition |
| no code or dependency manifests in R119-D files | pass: 0 |
| no other R119 files processed by R119-D | pass: other-thread files present but not read, modified, staged, or committed by R119-D |
| `git diff --check` for R119-D files | pass |

## Local Evidence Snapshot

| Evidence | Value |
| --- | --- |
| R119-D files present | 5 / 5 |
| central registered / active Pals | 9 / 9 |
| official Pal directories | 9 |
| official Pal `pal.json` parse failures | 0 |
| forbidden diff count for R119-D protected paths | 0 |
| exact route-map declaration count in R119-D files | 0 |
| concrete credential pattern count in R119-D files | 0 |
| code / dependency manifest additions in R119-D files | 0 |
| `git diff --check` for R119-D files | pass |

## Other-Thread Files Present

The following R119-looking files or directories were present during validation. They appear to belong to R119-A/B/C parallel work and were not read, modified, staged, unstaged, or committed by R119-D:

- `evals/palbench/asset-boundary/`
- `evals/palbench/fde-pack/`
- `evals/palbench/org-pack/r119a-org-pack-practical-structure-boundary.md`
- `examples/asset-boundary/`
- `examples/fde-packs/`
- `examples/org-packs/content-ops-org-pack/`
- `release/fresh-clone-checks/r119a-local-org-pack-practical-structure-validation.md`
- `release/fresh-clone-checks/r119b-local-fde-pack-standard-validation.md`
- `release/fresh-clone-checks/r119c-local-reusable-private-asset-boundary-validation.md`
- `release/integration-notes/r119a-index-update-notes.md`
- `release/integration-notes/r119b-index-update-notes.md`
- `release/integration-notes/r119c-index-update-notes.md`
- `standards/asset-boundary/`

- `standards/org-pack/org-pack-practical-structure.md`
- `templates/asset-boundary/`
- `templates/fde-pack/`
- `templates/org-pack/practical-org-pack/`

At final R119-D commit time, some R119-B FDE files were already staged by another thread. R119-D used path-limited commit handling and did not stage, unstage, modify, or commit those R119-B files.

## Not-Run Register

- No R119-A/B/C final outputs were validated by this thread.
- No fresh clone was created in a separate directory.
- No clean-copy integration run was performed.
- No Org Pack / FDE Pack / asset-boundary standard body was modified by R119-D.
- No shared entry file was modified by R119-D.
- No official Pal asset was modified by R119-D.
- No official Pal `pal.json` was modified.
- No new official Pal `asset-manifest.json` was generated.
- No external project binding was installed or modified.
- No external API, connector, MCP, plugin, Skill, or business system was called.
- No remote git operation was run.
- No tag or GitHub Release action was run.

## Boundary

This validation record is local evidence for the R119-D documentation-only thread. It is not the R120 integration result and must not be used to claim that R119-A/B/C outputs have passed.
