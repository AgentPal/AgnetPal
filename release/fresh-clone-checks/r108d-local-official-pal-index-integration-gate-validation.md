# R108-D Local Official Pal Index Integration Gate Validation

Date: 2026-06-28

## Summary

Decision: pass for the local R108-D gate assets, with other-thread R108 files present and intentionally not processed.

Scope: R108-D creates an integration gate, checklist, and issue template for a later R109 integration round. It does not modify official Pal assets, central contacts, shared entry files, or external project bindings.

Execution layer: current Codex local shell in `J:\开发\AgentPal`.

## Files Expected

- `evals/palbench/pal-asset/r108d-official-pal-index-integration-gate.md`
- `release/integration-notes/r108d-official-pal-index-integration-checklist.md`
- `release/integration-notes/r108d-official-pal-index-integration-issue-template.md`
- `release/fresh-clone-checks/r108d-local-official-pal-index-integration-gate-validation.md`

## Required Checks

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| integration gate exists | pass |
| integration checklist exists | pass |
| issue template exists | pass |
| validation file exists | pass |
| central roster parses | pass |
| central roster registered / active count | pass: registered 9, active 9 |
| central roster no keyword routing | pass: `routing_policy` is `ai_judgement_only`, `keyword_routing_allowed` is `false` |
| official Pal dirs count | pass: 9 |
| all official Pal `pal.json` parse | pass: 9 / 9 parse |
| no official Pal diff | note: current worktree has other-thread Mira skills index diff; R108-D did not read, modify, stage, or commit it |
| no central contacts diff | pass: 0 diffs under `workspace/organization/contacts/**` |
| no shared entry diff | pass: 0 diffs to `README.md`, `RESOURCE_INDEX.md`, or `agentpal.json` |
| no active keyword routing in R108-D files | pass: 0 exact route-map declarations |
| no concrete credentials in R108-D files | pass: 0 concrete credential patterns |
| no connector / scanner / marketplace program in R108-D files | pass: documentation-only; prohibited behavior is named only as a gate failure condition |
| no code or dependency manifests in R108-D files | pass: 0 |
| no other untracked R108 files | note: other-thread R108 files present; not processed, staged, or committed by R108-D |
| `git diff --check` for R108-D files | pass |

## Local Evidence Snapshot

| Evidence | Value |
| --- | --- |
| R108-D files present | 4 / 4 |
| central registered / active Pals | 9 / 9 |
| official Pal directories | 9 |
| official Pal `pal.json` parse failures | 0 |
| central contacts diff count | 0 |
| shared entry diff count | 0 |
| exact route-map declaration count in R108-D files | 0 |
| concrete credential pattern count in R108-D files | 0 |
| code / dependency manifest additions in R108-D files | 0 |
| `git diff --check` for R108-D files | pass |

## Other-Thread Files Present

The following R108-looking files or changes were present during validation. They appear to belong to other parallel threads and were not read, modified, staged, unstaged, or committed by R108-D:

- `official/pals/Mira-main/skills/index.md`
- `evals/palbench/pal-asset/r108a-mira-skills-index-boundary.md`
- `release/fresh-clone-checks/r108a-local-mira-skills-index-validation.md`
- `release/integration-notes/r108a-mira-skills-index-summary.md`

At final R108-D commit time, some R108-A files were staged by another thread. R108-D used path-limited commit handling and did not stage, unstage, modify, or commit the R108-A/B/C files.

R108-A/B/C commits were visible in history during final validation:

- `83768be docs: add Mira skills index`
- `6f3ac68 docs: add PalSmith skills index`
- `7e25242 test: audit Mira root entry binding wording`

## Baseline References Read

- `J:\开发\AgentPal_dcos\开发记录\R107-R106并行结果审查与OfficialPalSkillsIndex集成完成报告.md`
- `J:\开发\AgentPal_dcos\开发记录\R105-Mira-specific-PalAssetReview与memory-research-index补齐完成报告.md`

- `templates/pal-asset/safe-index-backfill-guide.md`
- `workspace/organization/contacts/pals.json`

## Not-Run Register

- No R108-A/B/C final outputs were validated by this thread.
- No fresh clone was created in a separate directory.
- No clean-copy integration run was performed.
- No official Pal asset was modified.
- No official Pal `pal.json` was modified.
- No real official `asset-manifest.json` was generated.
- No Agent Skill was copied into Pal `skills/`.
- No report body was copied into memory.
- No raw research was promoted directly to knowledge.
- No external project binding was installed or modified.
- No external API, connector, MCP, plugin, Skill, or business system was called.
- No remote git operation was run.
- No tag or GitHub Release action was run.

## Boundary

This validation record is local evidence for the R108-D documentation-only thread. It is not the R109 integration result and must not be used to claim that R108-A/B/C outputs have passed.
