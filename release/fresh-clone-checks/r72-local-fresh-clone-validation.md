# R72 Local Fresh Clone Validation

Date: 2026-06-27

Scope: local-only validation after grouped R72 commits. No push, tag, or GitHub Release was performed.

Fresh clone location: local temporary directory, not recorded in public release evidence.

## Result

- required paths missing: 0
- JSON files checked: 49
- JSON failures: 0
- fenced JSON failures in `templates/project-binding/project-json-template.md`: 0
- root `.agentpal/` present in clone: false
- nested `.git` directories: 0
- unexpected `workspace/projects/<project-id>` records: 0
- private/runtime leak count: 0
- internal report/path term hits: 0
- forbidden project-binding template directories created: 0

## Keyword Routing Check

`keyword_map`, `domain_map`, and `role_map` appear only in forbidden, regression, or boundary documentation contexts. The local fresh clone check found no active keyword/domain/role routing behavior.

## Notes

This file records local fresh-clone evidence only. It does not claim remote sync, tag creation, or GitHub Release publication.
