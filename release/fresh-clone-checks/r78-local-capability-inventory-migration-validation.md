# R78 Local Capability Inventory Migration Validation

Date: 2026-06-28

Scope: local-only validation for the staged migration of `capabilities/`, `runtime/`, `models/`, and `plugins/`.

## Directory Boundary

- Working directory: `J:\开发\AgentPal`
- Git top level: `J:/开发/AgentPal`
- Not `AgentPal_dcos`
- No `git push`, `git pull`, `git fetch`, tag, or GitHub Release action was run.

## Index Clean-Copy Evidence

Two full filesystem export attempts timed out in the local environment, so the final clean-copy validation used the staged Git index tree as the authoritative clean package source.

- Index tree used for clean-copy validation before adding this report: `c045cffd46a122937c5e5f580f07b4caf39079ce`
- Indexed paths in that validation tree: 2773
- After adding this report to the index, required paths and JSON parsing were rechecked: `required_missing=0`, `json_failures=0`
- Required paths missing: 0
- JSON files checked from index/worktree: 76 in worktree, 49 in staged index tree
- JSON failures: 0
- Private/runtime capability inventory leak: 0
- Active `keyword_map` / `domain_map` / `role_map` JSON keys: 0
- Official Pal dirs: 9
- Central roster registered Pal count: 9
- `routing_policy`: `ai_judgement_only`
- `keyword_routing_allowed`: `false`

## Root Pointer Status

| Root directory | Files remaining after R78 |
| --- | --- |
| `capabilities/` | `capabilities/README.md` |
| `runtime/` | `runtime/README.md` |
| `models/` | `models/README.md` |
| `plugins/` | `plugins/README.md` |

Each README is a temporary compatibility pointer to:

- `standards/capability-inventory/`
- `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/`
- `examples/capability-inventory/`
- `archive/migration-from-v0.3/root-legacy/capability-inventory/`

## Required Target Paths

All required target README paths exist:

- `standards/capability-inventory/README.md`
- `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/README.md`
- `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/runtimes/README.md`
- `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/models/README.md`
- `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/reasoning/README.md`
- `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/skills/README.md`
- `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/plugins/README.md`
- `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/mcp/README.md`
- `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/business-systems/README.md`
- `examples/capability-inventory/README.md`
- `archive/migration-from-v0.3/root-legacy/capability-inventory/README.md`

## Boundary Search Classification

Search hits for `.agentpal/memory`, `.agentpal/state`, `.agentpal/reports`, `.agentpal/context`, `.agentpal/index`, `.agentpal/pals`, `.agentpal/workflows`, and `.agentpal/evals` were classified as forbidden default directory lists, thin-binding boundary language, archive material, release evidence, or regression-test expectations. No active thick-binding behavior was found.

Search hits for `keyword_map`, `domain_map`, and `role_map` were classified as forbidden, boundary, archive, release evidence, or regression-test contexts. No active keyword/domain/role routing behavior was found.

Search hits for scanner/validator/daemon/auto-scan wording were classified as no-code boundary language, explicit forbidden claims, release checks, roadmap constraints, or examples showing what AgentPal is not. No active scanner, validator, daemon, automatic scan, or automatic execution claim was introduced.

## Thin Binding Status

The current project-binding templates remain thin:

- `templates/project-binding/generic-codex/.agentpal/project.json`
- `templates/project-binding/generic-codex/.agentpal/AGENTPAL.md`
- `templates/project-binding/generic-codex/AGENTS.agentpal-block.md`
- `templates/project-binding/claude-code/.agentpal/project.json`
- `templates/project-binding/claude-code/.agentpal/AGENTPAL.md`
- `templates/project-binding/claude-code/CLAUDE.agentpal-block.md`

No default `.agentpal/memory`, `.agentpal/state`, `.agentpal/reports`, `.agentpal/context`, `.agentpal/index`, `.agentpal/pals`, `.agentpal/workflows`, or `.agentpal/evals` directories were added.

## Result

R78 local capability inventory migration validation: pass.

Known limitation: the environment timed out when exporting the whole tree to a filesystem copy, so clean-copy evidence is based on the staged Git index tree plus direct worktree JSON parsing.
