# R108-C Local Mira Root Entry Wording Audit Validation

## Status

Pass.

## Date

2026-06-28

## Validation target

R108-C audit-only review of Mira root-entry and related thin-binding wording.

## Files audited

- `official/pals/Mira-main/README.md`
- `official/pals/Mira-main/PAL.md`
- `official/pals/Mira-main/AGENTS.md`
- `official/pals/Mira-main/SKILL.md`
- `official/pals/Mira-main/pal.json`
- `official/pals/Mira-main/memory/README.md`
- `official/pals/Mira-main/research/README.md`
- `templates/project-binding/`
- `docs/01-getting-started/bind-external-project.md`
- `workspace/organization/contacts/pals.json`
- `J:\开发\AgentPal_dcos\开发记录\R105-Mira-specific-PalAssetReview与memory-research-index补齐完成报告.md`

## Evidence summary

- Mira resolved from central contacts as `mira-main`, active Main Pal, pack path `official/pals/Mira-main`.
- All required Mira root entry files were present.
- `official/pals/Mira-main/pal.json` parsed successfully.
- One stale wording candidate was found in `official/pals/Mira-main/PAL.md` lines 230-235.
- The candidate says external project facts belong in the external project's `.agentpal/`.
- Current thin-binding docs and templates say project memory, derived knowledge, task records, reports, governance records, and capability inventory belong in central `agentpal_project_record`, not project-local `.agentpal/`.
- Mira `memory/README.md` and `research/README.md` already state not to write/copy Mira memory or research into external project `.agentpal/` directories by default.

## Other-thread files present

The worktree contained files from parallel R108 threads at validation time. They were not staged for the R108-C commit:

- `official/pals/Mira-main/skills/index.md`

- `evals/palbench/pal-asset/r108d-official-pal-index-integration-gate.md`

## Safe-fix candidate

For R109, update only the Mira `PAL.md` memory destination bullet:

```md
- external project facts: the central AgentPal project record under `workspace/projects/<project-id>/`, referenced by `agentpal_project_record`; do not write project memory into the external project's `.agentpal/` by default
```

## Boundary statement

R108-C is audit-only. It does not modify Mira root entries, official Pal metadata, central contacts, shared root entries, templates, runtime dependencies, scanners, validators, connectors, keyword routers, tags, releases, or remotes.

## Commit scope note

The R108-C commit scope is limited to the three public R108-C artifacts. Internal reporting stays under `J:\开发\AgentPal_dcos\开发记录\` and parallel R108-A/B/D artifacts are treated as other-thread files.

## Conclusion

Pass. R108-C identified and documented one safe-fix candidate for R109 while preserving the audit-only boundary.
