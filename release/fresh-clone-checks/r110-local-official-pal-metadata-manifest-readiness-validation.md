# R110 Local Official Pal Metadata / Manifest Readiness Validation

Date: 2026-06-28

## Status

Pass.

## Scope

Local validation for the R110 readiness planning gate.

R110 creates planning and gate artifacts only. It does not modify official Pal `pal.json`, does not generate official `asset-manifest.json`, and does not run remote Git operations.

## Initial evidence

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| operation directory | `J:\开发\AgentPal` |
| initial branch status | `## master...origin/master [ahead 54]` |
| initial worktree | clean |
| latest R109 commit | `eacb72c docs: integrate official pal index updates and fix Mira binding wording` |

## Planned R110 artifacts

| Artifact | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `evals/palbench/pal-asset/r110-official-pal-metadata-readiness-audit.md` | created |
| `release/integration-notes/r110-pal-json-v0.5-field-mapping-table.md` | created |
| `release/integration-notes/r110-asset-manifest-readiness-source-map.md` | created |
| `release/integration-notes/r110-official-pal-metadata-manifest-batch-proposal.md` | created |

| `release/fresh-clone-checks/r110-local-official-pal-metadata-manifest-readiness-validation.md` | created |
| internal report | created under `J:\开发\AgentPal_dcos\开发记录\` |

## Clean-copy validation

Status: pass.

Clean-copy path:

```text
C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\agentpal-r110-clean-ac7b80c70e754ee1afb1d17b0519ea76
```

Method:

1. Created a clean local copy from committed `HEAD` using `git archive`.
2. Overlaid only the R110 public planning artifacts.
3. Ran required path, JSON, schema, template, central roster, official Pal, manifest, routing, credential, and external `.agentpal` checks.

Results:

| Clean-copy check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| required R110 paths missing | `0` |
| JSON parse | pass: `62 / 62`; failures `0` |
| schema JSON parse | pass |
| template JSON parse | pass |
| central registered / active Pals | pass: `9 / 9` |
| official Pal directories | pass: `9` |
| official Pal `pal.json` parse failures | pass: `0` |
| official `asset-manifest.json` count | pass: `0` |
| route-map declarations in R110 files | pass: `0` |
| hard-route hits in R110 files | pass: `0` |
| credential patterns in R110 files | pass: `0` |
| external project thick `.agentpal` dirs | pass: `0` |
