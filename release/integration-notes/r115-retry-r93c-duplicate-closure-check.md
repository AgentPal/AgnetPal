# R115-retry R93-C Duplicate Closure Check

Date: 2026-06-28

## Purpose

Confirm that the delayed / duplicate R93-C thin binding simulation state is closed before continuing the PalSmith asset manifest dry-run proposal work.

## Status

Pass.

## R93-C Evidence

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| latest R93-C simulation commit | `7d9b99c test: add thin binding simulation results` | latest commit for `r93c-thin-binding-simulation-results.md` and `r93c-local-thin-binding-simulation-validation.md` |
| R93-C index note tracked | `11ff742 test: add thin binding simulation results` | latest commit for `r93c-index-update-notes.md` |
| internal completion report exists | pass | `J:\开发\AgentPal_dcos\开发记录\R93-C-ThinBinding真实临时项目模拟测试完成报告.md` |
| public simulation result exists | pass | `evals/palbench/project-binding/r93c-thin-binding-simulation-results.md` |
| public validation exists | pass | `release/fresh-clone-checks/r93c-local-thin-binding-simulation-validation.md` |
| integration note exists | pass | `release/integration-notes/r93c-index-update-notes.md` |

## R93-C Result Summary

The current R93-C records still report:

- Generic Codex simulation created only `.agentpal/project.json`, `.agentpal/AGENTPAL.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.
- Claude Code simulation created only `.agentpal/project.json`, `.agentpal/AGENTPAL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, and `.gitignore`.
- generated JSON parse passed.
- forbidden dirs count was `0`.
- no `official/pals`, central contacts, memory, reports, or evals were copied into temp projects.
- route-map tokens were prohibition text only, not generated route maps.
- no credential-like placeholders were generated.

## Shared Surface Check

| Surface | Result |
| --- | --- |
| current worktree state before R115-retry writes | clean: `## master...origin/master [ahead 62]` |
| shared entries diff (`README.md`, `RESOURCE_INDEX.md`, `agentpal.json`) | empty |
| `templates/project-binding/` diff | empty |
| central roster / contacts diff | empty |
| R93-C public simulation commit file surface | only simulation result and validation files in `7d9b99c` |

## Boundary

This closure check does not rerun or modify R93-C. It only records that the delayed R93-C state is already represented by existing public-safe evidence and does not block the PalSmith manifest dry-run proposal.

## Decision

Decision: `safe_to_continue_palsmith_manifest_dry_run`

R93-C duplicate / delayed state is closed for this retry. Continue R115-retry as PalSmith-only asset manifest dry-run proposal work.
