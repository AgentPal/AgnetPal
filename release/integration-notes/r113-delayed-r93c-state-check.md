# R113 Delayed R93-C State Check

Date: 2026-06-28

## Purpose

R113 first verifies that the delayed R93-C thin binding simulation has closed cleanly before starting the PalSmith `pal.json` v0.5 metadata update.

## Evidence Read

| Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `J:\开发\AgentPal_dcos\开发记录\R93-C-ThinBinding真实临时项目模拟测试完成报告.md` | exists |
| `evals/palbench/project-binding/r93c-thin-binding-simulation-results.md` | exists |
| `release/fresh-clone-checks/r93c-local-thin-binding-simulation-validation.md` | exists |
| `release/integration-notes/r93c-index-update-notes.md` | exists |

## R93-C Current State

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| R93-C latest local commit evidence | `7d9b99c test: add thin binding simulation results` |
| R93-C simulation result | pass |
| Generic Codex binding surface | 3 expected files only |
| Claude Code binding surface | 5 expected files only |
| forbidden project-local dirs | `0` |
| copied official Pal packs | no |
| copied central contacts | no |
| copied memory / reports / evals | no |

## Workspace Impact Check

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| current worktree before R113 metadata update | clean: `## master...origin/master [ahead 59]` |
| shared entry diff (`README.md`, `RESOURCE_INDEX.md`, `agentpal.json`) | empty |
| central roster diff | empty |
| `templates/project-binding/` diff | empty |
| R93-C untracked temp project in repository | none observed |

## Conclusion

Decision: `safe_to_continue_metadata_update`

R93-C is closed enough for R113 to proceed. The current state supersedes the older objective text that mentioned commit `11ff742`; the authoritative current R93-C commit evidence is `7d9b99c`.
