## Closure Summary

R93-C verified the migrated `templates/project-binding/` thin binding templates by generating local temp Generic Codex and Claude Code projects outside this repository. The generated file surfaces were limited to the expected thin binding entries, JSON parse passed, forbidden project-local AgentPal directories were absent, central contacts and official Pal Packs were not copied, and keyword/domain/role route-map tokens appeared only in prohibition text.

The R93-C internal report has been corrected to distinguish the latest evidence commit `7d9b99c` from the later R117 HEAD `45de643`. The current repository state no longer treats R93-C as an open blocker.

## Covered By Later Evidence

R93-C is covered by later v0.4 integration and regression evidence:

- R94 integrated R93 parallel evidence into the local release-support chain.
- R95 executed the v0.4 real-usage regression and included thin binding, central roster, no keyword routing, and public-safety surfaces.
- `release/current/v0.4-local-completion-report.md` cites R93/R94 integration and R95 regression as v0.4 completion evidence.

## Decision

No further R93-C action is needed in the current v0.5 local work.

R93-C should not be selected again as the next goal unless a required R93-C evidence file is later found missing or corrupted.
