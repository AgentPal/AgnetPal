# AgentPal v0.1.0-rc.1 Docs Audit

## Audit Date

2026-06-24

## Scope

This audit covers release-facing documentation boundaries for AgentPal v0.1.0-rc.1.

Primary files reviewed:

- root release notes, GitHub release draft, release checklist, contribution guide, third-party notices, and `.gitignore`
- `docs/03-pal-pack-standard/01-pal-pack-structure.md`
- `docs/03-pal-pack-standard/11-public-private-boundary.md`
- `docs/08-release-and-maintenance/00-release-process.md`
- `docs/08-release-and-maintenance/01-release-checklist.md`
- `docs/08-release-and-maintenance/02-public-safe-checklist.md`
- `docs/99-reference/known-limitations.md`

## Checks Performed

- Confirmed release docs describe AgentPal as a Pal Workspace and Pal Pack Standard practice.
- Confirmed Simple Pal Mode is the only active task-handling path in v0.1.0-rc.1.
- Checked that future subagent, child workflow, marketplace, desktop app, Pal Hub, OpenClaw, Hermes, and deep runtime adapter materials are not presented as active release features in the main release-facing docs.
- Confirmed public/private boundary docs are linked from release maintenance docs.
- Confirmed docs-side release checklist points to root release checklist instead of duplicating it fully.
- Ran a relative Markdown link check for the edited release maintenance docs and `release/` audit files.

## Findings

The release-facing docs now have a clear public-safe maintenance path:

- [Release process](../../docs/08-release-and-maintenance/00-release-process.md)
- [Release checklist](../../docs/08-release-and-maintenance/01-release-checklist.md)
- [Public-safe checklist](../../docs/08-release-and-maintenance/02-public-safe-checklist.md)
- [Known limitations](../../docs/99-reference/known-limitations.md)

The root docs and release notes checked during this pass are consistent with the v0.1.0-rc.1 boundary: Pal Workspace, Simple Pal Mode only, no active multi-agent runtime, no desktop app, no marketplace, and no active deep runtime adapters.

Some examples, evals, orchestration notes, and registry files mention subagent or future workflow ideas. These are acceptable only as future, experimental, or regression-reference material. They should not be promoted as current user-facing capability.

Edited release maintenance docs and release audit files passed relative Markdown link checks during this audit pass.

## Fixed Issues

- Replaced placeholder release maintenance docs with actionable release process and checklist content.
- Expanded the public-safe checklist to cover forbidden content, allowed content, memory/state/reports, Pal Pack public asset rules, runtime state exclusions, contributor checks, and maintainer release audit checks.
- Expanded known limitations to explicitly cover Simple Pal Mode, no desktop app, no Pal Hub/Marketplace, no automatic deep runtime adapters, and future-only subagent/child workflow materials.

## Remaining Risks

- Some docs are intentionally short placeholders from the docs information architecture pass. They are acceptable for rc.1 only if the main docs entry points and P0/P1 docs remain clear.
- The repository contains future-oriented design and eval material. Maintainers should keep it out of primary onboarding navigation unless it is clearly labeled.
- This pass used a lightweight relative-link check, not a full site build or rendered docs QA.

## Recommendation

Conditional pass for docs release readiness. The docs are suitable for rc.1 after final link verification and maintainer review of future-feature references.
