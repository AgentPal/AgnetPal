# AgentPal

**AgentPal is a lightweight framework for building multi-AI teams.**

AgentPal can be installed or mounted under Agent Runtimes such as Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode, so an existing Agent can gain an AI team organization layer made of multiple professional Pals.

AgentPal does not replace Agent systems such as Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, or workbuddy.
It focuses on a different question:

> How can users organize a collaborative AI team in a lighter, easier-to-maintain, lower-cost way?

In one sentence:

> **AgentPal = a Pal team organization layer for existing Agents.**

---

## Install

AgentPal is a local workspace. It is not an npm / pip package, not a CLI installer, and not a background service.

You can install it in either way:

### Option A: Download the release package

1. Download `agentpal-v0.5.0-rc.1.zip` from the GitHub Release.
2. Unzip it to a local folder, for example `<path-to-AgentPal>`.
3. Keep that folder as the AgentPal Workspace.
4. Open it in an Agent Runtime that can read local Markdown / JSON files.

### Option B: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentPal/AgentPal.git
cd AgentPal
```

Then open the cloned folder as the AgentPal Workspace.

The current recommended path is Codex. After opening the AgentPal folder, copy [`prompts/codex/initialize-agentpal-workspace.md`](prompts/codex/initialize-agentpal-workspace.md) into a fresh Codex conversation and confirm that Mira welcomes you and lists the current Pals.

## What Is A Pal?

AgentPal uses **Pals** as the basic organization unit of an AI team.

In AgentPal:

```text
Skill is a capability package.
Pal is a working partner that uses Skills.

Agent is the execution runtime.
Pal is a working partner that uses Agents.
```

In other words, a Pal is not a Skill and not a full Agent Runtime.

A Pal sits between Skill and Agent:

```text
Skill  -> capability package
Pal    -> working partner that uses Skills and Agents
Agent  -> execution runtime
```

A Pal can have its own identity, responsibility, knowledge, memory, Skills, workflow, and collaboration boundary.
It knows what it is responsible for, when it should use a Skill, and when it should hand the task to Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, or another Agent Runtime for execution.

---

## Skill, Pal, And Agent

### Skill Is A Capability Package

A Skill is usually a reusable capability, prompt, process, or tool-use instruction.

For example:

- writing style Skill
- code review Skill
- Office document Skill
- search and research Skill
- Skill for a tool or plugin

The value of a Skill is that it helps AI do a certain kind of work better.

But a Skill is usually lightweight. It usually does not carry a long-term role, memory, collaboration, project understanding, or team division of work.

> **A Skill gives AI a capability.**

### Agent Is The Execution Runtime

An Agent is the runtime layer that actually executes tasks.

For example: Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, OpenHands, or Agents created inside systems such as OpenClaw, Hermes, and workbuddy.

An Agent can read and write files, call tools, run commands, plan steps, and complete tasks.

> **An Agent executes.**

### Pal Is A Working Partner

A Pal is a working partner that uses Skills and Agents.

A Pal can:

- have a clear identity and responsibility
- remember users, projects, and past work
- use its own knowledge and workflow
- reference and combine multiple Skills
- judge which Agent Runtime should be used
- collaborate with other Pals
- split tasks to suitable Agents or sub-Agents
- summarize execution results and report back to the user

> **A Pal understands the role, organizes collaboration, uses Skills, and directs Agents to execute.**

## Pal Vs Skill

| Item | Skill | Pal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core positioning | capability package | working partner that uses capability packages |
| Identity | usually no | yes |
| Long-term responsibility | usually no | yes |
| Memory | usually no | yes |
| Knowledge system | limited | yes |
| Can combine multiple Skills | limited | yes |
| Can collaborate with other roles | usually no | yes |
| Can judge which Agent to use | usually no | yes |
| More like | tool capability | team member |

In short:

> **Skill is a capability. Pal is the working partner that knows how to use capabilities.**

---

## Pal Vs Agent

| Item | Agent | Pal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core positioning | execution runtime | working partner that uses Agents |
| Real execution | yes | usually handed to an Agent |
| Reads files / calls tools | yes | through an Agent or Skill |
| Stable role identity | not always | yes |
| Independent memory and knowledge | depends on the system | yes |
| Lightweight creation of many roles | higher cost | lighter |
| Suitable for organizing AI teams | possible, but usually heavier | naturally suitable |
| More like | executor / runtime | team member / task owner |

AgentPal does not want to rebuild an Agent Runtime.

Its goal is:

> **Give existing Agents team, role, memory, workflow, and collaboration ability.**

---

## Multi-Pal Vs Multi-Agent

Multi-Pal and multi-Agent teams share the same goal:

> They both use multiple AI roles to finish tasks that are more complex than what one AI can handle alone.

The difference is the implementation shape.

This is not a comparison between AgentPal and systems such as OpenClaw, Hermes, or workbuddy themselves.
It is a comparison between:

```text
Multi-Pal teams created by AgentPal
vs
Multi-Agent teams created inside systems such as OpenClaw / Hermes / workbuddy
```

| Item | Multi-Agent | Multi-Pal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Goal | multi-role collaboration | multi-role collaboration |
| Basic unit | Agent | Pal |
| Execution shape | multiple Agents run separately | Pals organize tasks and call Agents when needed |
| Usage complexity | usually higher | lighter |
| Runtime cost | can be higher | controllable |
| Context management | more complex across Agents | Pals share organization-layer context |
| Must every role run as an Agent? | usually yes | no |
| Friendly for ordinary users building a team | has a threshold | friendlier |
| Suitable for complex tasks | yes | also yes, with Agents called when needed |

AgentPal's idea is:

> **Not every AI role must become an independently running Agent.**

In many cases, a Pal only needs clear identity, knowledge, memory, and workflow to take a team role well.
Only when a task really needs independent context, parallel execution, isolation, or a professional toolchain does a Pal need to call a sub-Agent or external Agent.

So:

```text
Multi-Agent = multiple executing agents
Multi-Pal   = multiple collaborative working partners that use Agents
```

AgentPal can use multiple Agents, but it does not force every role to become an Agent.

## Use PalSmith And Faye To Build Your Own AI Team

The built-in PalSmith and Faye help users move from "using built-in Pals" to "creating their own professional AI team."

### PalSmith

PalSmith creates and governs Pals.

It can help you:

- create a new Pal
- design a Pal's identity, responsibility, knowledge, memory, and Skills
- check whether a Pal is too broad, too weak, or duplicated
- upgrade an existing Pal
- design a full Pal team

### Faye

Faye handles FDE-style solution design.

She can help turn real business needs into:

- business scenario definition
- user flow
- data list
- system interface list
- risks
- acceptance criteria
- delivery steps
- which Pals need to collaborate
- which parts need development
- which parts can be completed by existing Agents / Skills

PalSmith is better at building AI teams.
Faye is better at turning real business into an executable solution.
