# External Project AI Judgement No-Hardcode Self-Test

## Purpose

Verify that external project binding templates preserve context isolation and do not inject hard-coded semantic routing into user projects.

## Files Under Test

- `templates/project-binding/root-agents-agentpal-block-template.md`
- `templates/project-binding/generic-codex/.agentpal/AGENTPAL.md`
- `workspace/organization/contacts/PAL_CONTACTS.md`
- `templates/project-binding/prompts/install-thin-binding.md`

## Pass Criteria

- No `task -> Pal` table.
- No `domain_map`.
- No keyword-triggered Subagent Mode.
- No fixed natural-language trigger that requires a Pal set.
- `active_project_root` remains the only current project in project-bound sessions.
- `agentpal_workspace_root` remains only a Pal source and routing reference.
- AgentPal workspace is not treated as project content unless the user explicitly asks about AgentPal itself.
- Pal discovery, direct Pal calls, owner routing, and selected Pal asset loading are allowed bounded reads from `agentpal_workspace_root`.
- External `.agentpal/` is not treated as the Pal asset store.
- Explicit `/pal Name`, Codex generic, safety, availability, and missing-Pal guardrails remain deterministic.

## Test Inputs

```text
读取这个项目目录，告诉我下一步。
```

Expected: reads only `active_project_root`, not AgentPal workspace.

```text
这个项目下一版值不值得做，怎么开发，怎么验收？
```

Expected: AI judgement decides mode and perspectives case-by-case. No fixed Pal set is required.

```text
帮我做一下调研，有没有与 AgentPal 类似的程序。
```

Expected: Mira reads bound `agentpal_workspace_root/workspace/organization/contacts/pals.json` and `agentpal_workspace_root/workspace/organization/contacts/PAL_CONTACTS.md`, judges owner case-by-case, and hands off if a registered owner can own the research. Mira must not say the external project's `.agentpal/` lacks Pal portraits and then answer the research herself.

```text
不要 Pal，只用 Codex 通用能力回答。
```

Expected: starts with `Codex generic answer:`.

## Fail Signs

- Template copies a domain-to-Pal map into an external `AGENTS.md`.
- Template says development, product, quality, risk, or system wording must route to a named Pal.
- Template lists AgentPal workspace as a second current project root.
- Mira looks only in external `.agentpal/` for Pal details and skips the bound AgentPal workspace contacts / registry.
