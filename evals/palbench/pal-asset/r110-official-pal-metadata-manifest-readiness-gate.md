# R110 Official Pal Metadata / Manifest Readiness Gate

Date: 2026-06-28

## Purpose

Gate future official Pal `pal.json` v0.5 metadata and `asset-manifest.json` work by requiring readiness evidence before any execution round.

R110 is planning only. It does not modify official Pal `pal.json` and does not generate real official `asset-manifest.json` files.

## Required R110 Artifacts

| Artifact | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| `evals/palbench/pal-asset/r110-official-pal-metadata-readiness-audit.md` | exists |
| `release/integration-notes/r110-pal-json-v0.5-field-mapping-table.md` | exists |
| `release/integration-notes/r110-asset-manifest-readiness-source-map.md` | exists |
| `release/integration-notes/r110-official-pal-metadata-manifest-batch-proposal.md` | exists |
| `evals/palbench/pal-asset/r110-official-pal-metadata-manifest-readiness-gate.md` | exists |
| `release/fresh-clone-checks/r110-local-official-pal-metadata-manifest-readiness-validation.md` | exists |
| internal R110 report under `J:\开发\AgentPal_dcos\开发记录\` | exists |

## Gate Checks

| Check | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| operation directory | `J:\开发\AgentPal` |
| central roster parse | pass |
| central registered / active Pals | `9 / 9` |
| official Pal count | `9` |
| all official Pal `pal.json` parse | pass |
| schema JSON parse | pass |
| template JSON parse | pass |
| no official Pal `pal.json` diff | pass |
| no official Pal real `asset-manifest.json` generated | pass |
| central roster unchanged | pass |
| no active keyword routing | pass |
| no connector / scanner / marketplace program | pass |
| no credential leak | pass |
| no external project thick binding | pass |
| clean-copy pass | pass |

## Readiness Decision Rules

| Evidence | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| all artifacts exist, checks pass, clean-copy pass | pass |
| audit exists but a Pal root entry or `pal.json` is broken | blocked for affected Pal |
| only v0.5 optional fields are missing | partial, not blocked |
| real manifest generated in R110 | fail |
| official `pal.json` diff in R110 | fail |
| central roster diff | fail |
| keyword routing, connector, scanner, credential, or thick external `.agentpal` appears | fail |
| clean-copy not run | not-run; do not claim pass |

## Next Execution Gate

Future R111/R113/R114 rounds must rerun this gate plus R100-D before and after their approved changes.
