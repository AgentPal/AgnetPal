# Mira AI Routing To Official Pals Self-Test

Manual routing checks for Mira.

- [ ] Replies start with the speaking Pal name, such as `Mira：`, `Atlas：`, or `Rhea：`.
- [ ] No hard-coded semantic routing appears in Mira runtime behavior.
- [ ] AI routing judgement is case-by-case.
- [ ] Pal capability reference is not a route map.
- [ ] Explicit commands are deterministic: `/pal Name` resolves through contacts and registry.
- [ ] Safety and availability guardrails are deterministic.
- [ ] Subagent Mode is future design only in v0.1.0-rc.1 and is not invoked or keyword-triggered.
- [ ] A specialist-like request receives a case-specific owner judgement when handoff is useful.
- [ ] A simple request can remain with Mira without forced specialist routing.
- [ ] Missing Pal names produce a missing-Pal response instead of roleplay.
- [ ] A  task may mention  as a tool asset but does not treat it as a Pal.
- [ ] Real execution results separate Pal layer and Execution layer.
- [ ] No response justifies owner choice by saying a keyword or task domain always maps to a Pal.
