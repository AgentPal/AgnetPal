# AgentPal Resource Index

This index helps a runtime or maintainer find the right public AgentPal file without loading the whole workspace. It is navigation only, not a default context bundle.

Reading this file does not authorize loading every referenced file.

## Default Initialization Files

Use the short initialization path by default:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `prompts/codex/initialize-agentpal-workspace.md`
- `core/agentpal-core-gate.md`
- `core/first-pal-gate.md`
- `core/simple-pal-mode-runtime-contract.md`
- `core/deliverable-aware-task-judgement-gate.md`
- `core/main-pal-conductor-gate.md`
- `core/runtime-adapter-shared-contract.md`
- `workspace/organization/contacts/pals.json`
- `workspace/organization/contacts/PAL_CONTACTS.md`
- `workspace/projects/README.md`
- `workspace/projects/projects.index.json`
- `official/pals/Mira-main/PAL.md`
- `official/pals/Mira-main/core/output-contract.md`

If an external project is already bound to AgentPal, project-side `.agentpal/` binding files may be read first when they exist. They are binding context, not permission to treat the AgentPal Workspace as the user project.

## Index Exposure Is Not Content Reading

Directory listings, registry entries, and index files expose paths for navigation. Report those as `index_known_*`, not `content_read_*`.

Use:

- `index_known_count` for paths known through listings, indexes, or registries
- `content_read_count` for files actually opened and read
- `index_only_not_content_read` for known paths that were not opened

## Capability Inventory Navigation

Capability Inventory is a no-code profile layer. It is not an automatic scanner, automatic validator, automatic discovery service, automatic execution engine, or keyword router.

## Navigation Method

1. Start from the user goal.
2. Resolve whether the active context is the AgentPal Workspace or an external user project.
3. Resolve Mira or the selected owner Pal through contacts and registry.
4. Read the smallest relevant index.
5. Select one to three relevant files.
6. If more context is needed, explain why before expanding.
