# AgentPal Resource Index

This index helps a runtime or maintainer find the right public AgentPal file without loading the whole workspace. It is navigation only, not a default context bundle.

Reading this file does not authorize loading every referenced file.

## Default Initialization Files

Use the short initialization path by default:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `prompts/codex/initialize-agentpal-workspace.md`
- `core/agentpal-core-gate.md`
- `core/first-pal-gate.md`
- `core/simple-pal-mode-runtime-contract.md`
- `core/deliverable-aware-task-judgement-gate.md`
- `core/main-pal-conductor-gate.md`
- `core/runtime-adapter-shared-contract.md`
- `workspace/organization/contacts/pals.json`
- `workspace/organization/contacts/PAL_CONTACTS.md`
- `workspace/projects/README.md`
- `workspace/projects/projects.index.json`
- `official/pals/Mira-main/PAL.md`
- `official/pals/Mira-main/core/output-contract.md`

If an external project is already bound to AgentPal, project-side `.agentpal/` binding files may be read first when they exist. They are binding context, not permission to treat the AgentPal Workspace as the user project.

## Index Exposure Is Not Content Reading

Directory listings, registry entries, and index files expose paths for navigation. Report those as `index_known_*`, not `content_read_*`.

Use:

- `index_known_count` for paths known through listings, indexes, or registries
- `content_read_count` for files actually opened and read
- `index_only_not_content_read` for known paths that were not opened

## Capability Inventory Navigation

Capability Inventory is a no-code profile layer. It is not an automatic scanner, automatic validator, automatic discovery service, automatic execution engine, or keyword router.

### Capability Inventory Standards

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `standards/capability-inventory/` | standards, matrices, protocols, and profile rules |
| `standards/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-standard.md` | Business System profile standard for external system governance boundaries |
| `standards/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-review-flow.md` | Business System profile review flow standard for project usage memory to organization profile review |
| `docs/05-orchestration-methodology/capability-inventory-minimal-usable-design.md` | minimal usable design for manual profile records |

### Capability Inventory Templates

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `templates/capability-inventory/` | copyable JSON templates only, not current facts |
| `templates/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-template.json` | copyable Business System profile template for external system governance notes, not a connector |
| `templates/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-review-packet.md` | copyable no-code Business System profile review packet template |

### Capability Inventory Examples

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `examples/capability-inventory/` | illustrative examples only, not proof of current availability |
| `examples/capability-inventory/business-system-profiles/` | public-safe Business System profile examples, not connectors or credentials |
| `examples/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-reviews/` | public-safe Business System profile review examples, not organization truth updates |
| `examples/capability-inventory/business-system-profiles/github-public-governance-profile.example.json` | GitHub governance example using placeholder `example-org/example-repo` |
| `examples/capability-inventory/business-system-profiles/notion-public-governance-profile.example.json` | Notion governance example with unknown workspace, database, write, and API access |

| `examples/project-records/business-system-profile-references/content-ops-demo/` | public-safe central project record example referencing the Notion profile; not a real `workspace/projects/<project-id>` record |
| `examples/project-records/business-system-profile-references/sales-ops-demo/` | public-safe central project record example referencing the Generic CRM profile; not a real `workspace/projects/<project-id>` record |

| `examples/capability-inventory/business-system-profiles/unknown-not-run-missing-examples.md` | evidence-state examples for `unknown`, `not-run`, and `missing` |
| `examples/capability-inventory/business-system-profiles/non-verifiable-business-system-fields.md` | fields that require user confirmation, host Runtime evidence, UI/export evidence, or admin confirmation |
| `examples/failures/business-system-profile-as-connector.md` | forbidden failure example for connector, credential, auto scan, and keyword route misuse |

### Organization Capability Records

## Navigation Method

1. Start from the user goal.
2. Resolve whether the active context is the AgentPal Workspace or an external user project.
3. Resolve Mira or the selected owner Pal through contacts and registry.
4. Read the smallest relevant index.
5. Select one to three relevant files.
6. If more context is needed, explain why before expanding.
