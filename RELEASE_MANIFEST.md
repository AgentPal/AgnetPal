## Scope

AgentPal v0.1.0-rc.1 is a Markdown / JSON / protocol workspace for Pal Packs. It is a Pal layer for existing agent runtimes, not an Agent layer, not a multi-agent runtime, and not an execution layer.

Included:

- root initialization files: `AGENTS.md`, `PAL.md`, `SKILL.md`, and `agentpal.json`
- Codex initialization prompt: `prompts/codex/initialize-agentpal-workspace.md`
- public release docs: `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `GITHUB_RELEASE_DRAFT.md`, `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and this manifest
- navigation index: `RESOURCE_INDEX.md`
- shared core gates under `core/` for Codex, Claude Code, generic CLI, and project-bound sessions
- official bundled Pal Packs under `pals/`
- PalSmith no-code Pal asset governance docs, Runtime Task Package standard links, task package templates, example task packages, Markdown evals, and release-scope review
- PalSmith source lineage, source inventory, source coverage matrix, and no-code governance review assets
- contacts and registry files under `contacts/` and `registry/`
- orchestration protocols, templates, examples, evals, prompts, runtime compatibility notes, capability profiles, and research docs
- deliverable-aware task judgement protocol, staged Task Package example, failure regression example, and orchestration self-test
- thin external project binding templates and Claude Code / generic CLI Agent one-prompt setup prompts
- runtime-adapter thin binding examples and self-tests
- Claude Code post-install Mira welcome output requirements
- release evidence drafts under `release/v0.1.0-rc.1/`

Not included:

- desktop app, web UI, daemon, service, scanner, validator, installer, or required runtime dependency
- active Subagent Mode, active Deep Conductor execution, remote Agent orchestration, MCP-hosted Agent execution, or marketplace runtime
- private user memory, private project state, real customer data, real secrets, local machine paths, copied internal development reports, temporary screenshots, or temporary pasted text attachments
- ignored local runtime outputs such as `.agentpal/` and `exports/`
- copied full AgentPal rule bodies, full Pal rosters, full protocols, release docs, examples, or evals inside external project bindings

- Ignored local outputs `.agentpal/` and `exports/` were observed as local/runtime artifacts, not release content.
- Secret-key keyword hits were reviewed as public safety-boundary language, not real credentials.
- Hard-coded semantic routing hits were reviewed as prohibitions, negative examples, or non-binding examples.
- Subagent / Deep Conductor hits were reviewed as future-design or negative-boundary references, not active v0.1.0-rc.1 behavior.

## Local Git Boundary

The final release gate should observe local Git state only until maintainers explicitly publish:

- local tag `v0.1.0-rc.1` must point at the final intended release commit
- remote `origin` is configured as `https://github.com/AgentPal/AgnetPal.git`
- no push was performed during the local gate
- no GitHub Release was created or verified
- R12 did not stage, commit, tag, push, publish, or create a GitHub Release
- R14 did not stage, commit, tag, push, publish, or create a GitHub Release

If maintainers accept additional documentation changes after a local tag is created, they should create the final intended release commit, retag `v0.1.0-rc.1` if needed, then push the commit and tag before creating the GitHub Release.
