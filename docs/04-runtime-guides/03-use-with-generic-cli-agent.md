# Use With Generic CLI Agent

This guide covers the generic compatibility path for AgentPal v0.1.0-rc.1.

## When This Path Fits

Use this path when your CLI agent can:

- read directories and local files
- follow Markdown / JSON instructions
- keep project context stable across the task
- report what it really executed

AgentPal does not promise that every CLI agent has been validated. This is a generic compatibility guide.

## Quick Start

```text
cd <your-project>
<your-cli-agent>
```

Then paste the one-prompt project connection prompt from `prompts/cli-agent/install-agentpal-current-project.md`.

The prompt begins with:

```text
Please connect AgentPal to the current project.

AGENTPAL_HOME = <replace-with-your-AgentPal-path>
```

## What This Path Creates

- `.agentpal/` project binding files
- `AGENTS.md` workgroup block for the current project

It does not require Claude Code local settings, and it should not create runtime-specific files unless the current project already uses them or the user asks.

## Important Boundary

- The current project stays the active task context.
- The AgentPal Workspace is a reference workspace, not the user project.
- AgentPal is a Pal layer, not an Agent runtime or execution layer.
- The active path is `Simple Pal Mode only`.
- Deep Conductor, Subagent Mode, and external Agent orchestration are not active here.
