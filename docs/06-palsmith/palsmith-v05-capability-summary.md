# PalSmith v0.5 Capability Summary

Readiness: `ready_for_release_prep`

PalSmith v0.5 is a no-code Pal asset governance Pal. It helps users and maintainers design, review, install, authorize, revoke, and improve Pal assets without becoming a runtime or backend.

## Capability Overview

PalSmith can prepare:

- Pal creation plans;
- composite Pal distillation plans;
- draft Pal Packs;
- user custom Pal installation plans;
- authorization and revocation records;
- Pal Team designs;
- Runtime Task Packages for approved host-runtime work;
- quality and release-readiness reviews.

## Composite Pal Creation

PalSmith v0.5 can combine:

- thinking style distillation;
- personality, tone, and expression style distillation;
- role and job responsibility modeling;
- job knowledge and source-boundary planning;
- Skill, Agent, workflow, memory, contacts, and Marketplace metadata planning.

This is a planning and asset-governance capability. It does not automatically generate, install, register, or publish a Pal without host-runtime evidence and user confirmation.

## Draft Pal Pack Creation

PalSmith can create and review non-official draft Pal Packs. R174-R178 use `FirstPrinciplesProductReviewer` as a draft test artifact.

Draft Pal Packs remain outside central contacts and outside the official Pal roster.

## Draft-To-Custom Installation

PalSmith can prepare a no-code plan and Runtime Task Package for installing a reviewed draft as a user custom Pal.

The default user custom boundary is:

- `official: false`
- private by default
- discovery disabled by default
- no central contacts write
- no public Marketplace listing

## Invocation And Discovery

A user custom Pal may be explicitly invoked by the user when the host runtime has enough context.

General discovery remains disabled until the user explicitly authorizes a scoped discovery policy.

## Authorization, Delegation, Contacts, And Marketplace Boundaries

PalSmith separates:

- discovery;
- invocation;
- limited delegation;
- contacts registration;
- Marketplace draft metadata;
- public listing request.

Opening one field does not open another.

## Revocation, Expiry, And Audit Trail

PalSmith can prepare revocation and expiry handling records. Revocation should preserve audit history, disable selected scope only, and leave unrelated fields unchanged.

R191 validates this through real host read-only / dry-run evidence. It does not claim live revocation write execution.

## Quality Evidence

R168-R191 include:

- real host dialogue and read-only regression evidence;
- file-level regression evidence;
- Quinn review;
- external readability review;
- resource index and no-code boundary audits.

## Explicit Non-Capabilities

PalSmith v0.5 does not include:

- runtime backend;
- CLI;
- installer;
- daemon;
- scanner;
- connector backend;
- Marketplace backend;
- automatic central contacts writes;
- automatic official Pal promotion;
- automatic public Marketplace listing.

## v0.5 Readiness Verdict

`readiness: ready_for_release_prep`

PalSmith is ready for a v0.5 release-prep package. Push, tag, and GitHub Release still require separate user authorization.
