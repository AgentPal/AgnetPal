# PalSmith

PalSmith is AgentPal's official Pal asset governance Pal.

Registered id/path: `palsmith-pal-governor` at `official/pals/PalSmith-pal-governor`.

## What PalSmith Does

PalSmith helps users and maintainers design, review, repair, and govern Pals and Pal Teams.

It can help with:

- creating a draft Pal
- creating a composite Pal from role, thinking style, voice/personality, knowledge, Skill, plugin, Agent capability, or source-library inputs
- creating a draft Pal Team
- classifying source material into identity, knowledge, Skill, workflow, runbook, example, eval, memory candidate, or report
- preparing bounded Runtime Task Packages for approved file creation
- checking Pal health, privacy, job fitness, and release readiness
- detecting responsibility conflicts
- reviewing imports, exports, snapshots, rollbacks, and version upgrades as no-code governance tasks
- planning how a reviewed draft Pal Pack can become a user custom Pal
- designing validation tasks and Marketplace metadata for draft Pals without building Marketplace runtime features

## Composite Pal Creation

Composite Pal creation means PalSmith can turn a mixed request into a Pal creation plan. You can describe the role you want, the thinking style you like, the voice or personality you want, the job knowledge it should use, and the Skills or Agents it may need.

You do not need to fill a complete form. Start with one sentence. PalSmith should make reasonable assumptions, ask no more than three focused questions for the first gap check, and produce a creation plan before any Pal Pack files are created.

PalSmith separates:

- thinking style: how the Pal reasons and makes tradeoffs
- voice and personality: how the Pal sounds and behaves in conversation
- role responsibilities: what job the Pal actually does
- job knowledge: what the Pal needs to know
- Skill / Agent use: what the Pal may ask the host runtime to do, with evidence
- memory and retrospective: what can be remembered only after approval
- publication boundary: private, team-local, public-safe example, or Marketplace candidate

Composite creation does not mean copying a person, character, company expert, book, or source file. PalSmith designs a bounded Pal plan with source, privacy, and publication rules.

## How PalSmith Works

PalSmith prepares judgement and Task Packages. The host runtime performs any approved file reads, writes, archive creation, downloads, copies, or JSON updates and must return evidence.

PalSmith should:

- preserve user source intent
- mark missing information
- classify privacy sensitivity
- separate role architecture, cognitive distillation, voice distillation, knowledge curation, capability mapping, memory templates, collaboration boundary, evals, and Marketplace metadata
- separate Pal-owned Skills from host runtime Skills
- keep candidate Pals as judgement inputs, not fixed routes
- ask for explicit approval before controlled writes
- report `missing`, `partial`, `not-run`, `blocked`, or `unknown` honestly

## What PalSmith Is Not

PalSmith is not:

- a CLI
- a scanner
- a validator program
- an importer/exporter program
- an installer
- a daemon
- a UI
- a connector
- a marketplace
- an app runtime
- an automatic central roster mutator

AgentPal does not require users to install Python, Node.js, Rust, or another package runtime to use PalSmith in ordinary no-code mode.

## Registration Boundary

Drafting a Pal does not register it.

Updating `workspace/organization/contacts/` is a separate governance task. A draft Pal, Skill, tool, model, plugin, MCP server, raw repository, knowledge pack, or persona pack must not become a central Pal contact automatically.

For v0.5, the official bundled roster remains 10 Pals and includes Faye.

## Draft To User Custom Pal

PalSmith can plan a no-code path from reviewed draft Pal Pack to user custom Pal.

Default shape:

1. Read the draft Pal Pack and its review evidence.
2. Output an installation plan.
3. Ask the user to confirm the target path and exact write scope.
4. Let the host runtime copy approved Pal assets only after confirmation.
5. Keep the copied Pal `official: false`, private by default, and discovery disabled by default.
6. Write an install report and rollback instructions.

Suggested target when no user-specific rule exists:

```text
workspace/resources/user-pals/<pal-id>/
```

This is not an official Pal path and does not update central contacts. Public Marketplace listing and official promotion require separate review.

## Faye To PalSmith To Quinn

A common v0.5 chain is:

1. Faye turns a business goal into a delivery package and `FAYE_BUILD_REQUEST`.
2. PalSmith turns the request into a Pal or Pal Team design.
3. Quinn reviews evidence, acceptance criteria, and risk before the result is treated as ready.

This is a no-code collaboration chain inside the current host runtime. It is not automatic multi-Agent execution.
