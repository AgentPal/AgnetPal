# Quick Start

Use this path when you want to try AgentPal v0.1.0-rc.1 in Codex, Claude Code, or another Markdown/JSON-capable runtime.

For real user projects in Claude Code or generic CLI Agents, prefer the project-first workflow:

```text
cd <your-project>
claude
```

Then paste the one-prompt install prompt from `prompts/claude-code/install-agentpal-current-project.md` and provide `<path-to-AgentPal>`.

## Steps

1. Clone or download the AgentPal Workspace.
2. Open the AgentPal directory in your runtime.
3. Paste or run the contents of `INIT_PROMPT.md`.
4. Start ordinary messages with Mira.
5. Use `/pal Name` to call a registered Pal directly.

Example:

```text
/pal Harper Help me rewrite this release note.
```

## What Should Happen

- Mira is the default Main Pal, Leader Pal, and Conductor.
- Specialist Pals do not listen by default.
- Direct calls resolve from `contacts/` and `registry/`.
- Simple Pal Mode remains the only active task-handling path.

## No Required Runtime Dependency

AgentPal initialization does not require Python, Node.js, Rust, Go, a desktop app, a web UI, a daemon, a scanner, a validator, or an installer.
