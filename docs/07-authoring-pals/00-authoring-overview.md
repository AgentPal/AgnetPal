# Authoring Overview

## Status

Current for AgentPal `v0.1.0-rc.1`.

Authoring a Pal means creating a valid Pal Pack directory. Start small; a minimal Pal Pack can be useful before it has many Skills or knowledge cards.

## Basic Flow

1. Choose a clear role and boundary.
2. Create `pals/<Pal-Directory>/`.
3. Add the required root files.
4. Add `core/output-contract.md` and `core/task-loop.md`.
5. Add identity support files.
6. Add placeholder indexes and README files.
7. Add knowledge, Skills, runbooks, workflows, examples, and evals only as they become useful.
8. Register the Pal in contacts / registry after it is valid.

## Minimum Directory Reminder

Use [Pal Pack structure](../03-pal-pack-standard/01-pal-pack-structure.md) as the required shape. Directories can be light, but placeholder indexes and README files matter because they tell the runtime what is intentionally empty.

## Validity Rule

The Pal must be able to produce a valid Pal answer: prefix, identity, output contract, relevant asset or fallback, and no unsupported execution claim.
