# Project Usage Memory Boundary

Project usage memory records what happened in one project.

It is not organization truth.

It may suggest a future organization-level review.

It must not silently update organization capability profiles.

It must not update the central Pal roster.

It must not update no-keyword-routing policy.

It must not be copied into external project `.agentpal/` by default.

## Correct Use

Project usage memory can record project-specific evidence such as:

- a check that was not run
- a missing confirmation
- a host Runtime result for one project
- a project-specific limitation
- a recommendation to review an organization profile later

It cannot certify global access, global write permission, global API access, or central Pal ownership.

## Example

Good:

```text
In content-ops-demo, Notion write permission check was not-run.
```

Bad:

```text
Therefore Notion write access is available globally.
```

Correct:

```text
Record project-level not-run. If user later confirms access, propose an organization profile review.
```

## Organization Profile Review

When project usage memory suggests a Business System capability may be available, create a review packet instead of updating organization truth directly.

Use:

```text
standards/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-review-flow.md
templates/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-review-packet.md
```

The review packet can recommend a manual organization profile update. It must not auto-update `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/`, modify `workspace/organization/contacts/pals.json`, write into an external project `.agentpal/reviews/`, create a connector, store credentials, or route by keywords.

If a review packet is approved as `approved_for_manual_update`, create a Manual Update Evidence Pack before any profile edit:

```text
standards/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-manual-update-evidence-pack.md
templates/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-manual-update-evidence-pack.md
```

The evidence pack records the approved change, evidence summary, user confirmation, host Runtime evidence, rollback note, manual writeback target, and second verification status. It still must not auto-update the organization profile, modify central contacts, create a connector, store credentials, route by keywords, or write into an external project `.agentpal/evidence/`.

If a manual writeback has already happened, create a Manual Writeback Replay Record to audit the completed action:

```text
standards/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-manual-writeback-replay-record.md
templates/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-manual-writeback-replay-record.md
```

The replay record logs changed fields, previous and updated profile snapshot summaries, rollback record, second verification status, not-run checks, and missing evidence. It still must not execute writeback, auto-rollback, modify central contacts, create a connector, store credentials, route by keywords, or write into external project `.agentpal/replay/`, `.agentpal/rollback/`, or `.agentpal/verification/`.

When several review packets, evidence packs, replay records, rollback records, or second verification records exist, create an Audit Trail Index to summarize the chain:

```text
standards/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-audit-trail-index.md
templates/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-audit-trail-index.md
```

The audit trail index records related paths, statuses, current profile status summary, open unknowns, not-run checks, missing evidence, risks, and next manual action suggestions. It still must not execute actions, auto-call external APIs, auto-close missing evidence, modify central contacts, create a connector, store credentials, route by keywords, or write into external project `.agentpal/audit-trail/`.

After review, evidence, replay, and audit trail review, create a Governance Decision Record to capture the human governance decision:

```text
standards/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-governance-decision-record.md
templates/capability-inventory/business-system-profile-governance-decision-record.md
```

The governance decision record can approve a bounded manual profile update, reject it, block it for missing evidence, require user confirmation, require host Runtime evidence, require second verification, or supersede an earlier decision. It still must not execute writeback, automatically approve or reject reviews, auto-close missing evidence, convert not-run to pass, modify central contacts, create a connector, store credentials, route by keywords, or write into external project `.agentpal/governance-decisions/`.

## Boundary Checklist

- Keep project usage memory under the central project record.
- Keep external project `.agentpal/` thin by default.
- Do not update `workspace/organization/contacts/pals.json`.
- Do not update `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/` without explicit review.
- Do not convert `unknown`, `not-run`, or `missing` into a pass.
- Do not use project usage memory as `keyword_map`, `domain_map`, `role_map`, or deterministic routing.
- Do not convert `second_verification_not_run` into `second_verification_passed`.
- Do not treat a replay record as an execution engine or automatic rollback program.
- Do not treat an audit trail index as an execution engine, external API caller, or automatic missing-evidence closer.
- Do not treat a governance decision record as an approval engine, execution engine, central roster update, or automatic organization profile writeback.
