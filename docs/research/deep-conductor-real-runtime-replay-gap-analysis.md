# Deep Conductor Real Runtime Replay Gap Analysis

## Purpose

This public analysis turns the R61 real host-Runtime replay findings into concrete R62 repair targets.

It classifies each Deep Conductor ability as `pass`, `partial`, `unavailable`, or `fail`. The classification is about no-code package readiness and host Runtime followability. It is not evidence that AgentPal performs automatic execution.

## Classification Matrix

| Ability | Status | Evidence | Gap | Blocker | R62 repair | Needs future runtime replay |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deep Planning | pass | R61 project release and synthesis audit showed the E2E package can include memory, Capability Inventory, Context Budget, topology, Runtime packages, verification, Routing Memory, and next-round recommendation. | Planning remains package-level until a host Runtime executes the approved scope. | no | Add feasibility and readiness fields so package status is explicit. | yes, for release-readiness tasks with live host evidence |
| Task Decomposition | pass | R61 research-to-HTML replay separated research, artifact, document, safety, and verification stages. | Stage candidates need clearer execution feasibility per host Runtime. | no | Add execution feasibility and runtime availability evidence fields. | yes, for composite research/artifact tasks |
| Pal Dispatch | pass | Stage candidates were selected case-by-case from contacts / registry and not by fixed route. | Routing Memory recommendations need stronger candidate language when a capability is unavailable. | no | Strengthen Routing Memory and Conductor Decision records. | yes, after multiple real outcomes |
| Runtime Task Package | partial | R61 packages were followable, but host assumptions and stop conditions were implicit in places. | Execution assumptions, availability-first checks, and final evidence fields need to be explicit. | no | Harden next-round and Runtime Skill-aware package templates. | yes |
| Runtime Skill Orchestration | partial | R61 showed availability and fallback logic works as package design. | Actual Skill quality cannot be scored without host evidence; fallback and unknown states need stronger required fields. | no | Strengthen availability check and fallback templates. | yes, with named host Skills |
| Subagent / External Agent Handoff | unavailable | R61 G recorded current Simple Pal Mode as policy-blocked for probing or calling subagents/external Agents. | Manual handoff package exists only in internal replay; public boundary and template were missing. | not for no-code work | Add boundary protocol, handoff package, subagent task package, unavailable example, and self-test. | yes, only when a future host Runtime explicitly supports and permits it |
| Verification | pass | R61 D blocked a fake completion report with no evidence. | Verification package should preserve missing evidence in synthesis and final reports. | no | Add capability status and short summary fields to E2E synthesis. | yes |
| Context Budget | partial | R61 used bounded reads and avoided full-workspace loading. | Context Usage Report needs shorter user-facing shape and clearer "what was saved" fields. | no | Strengthen Context Budget and Context Usage Report; add short summary template. | yes |
| Routing Memory Candidate | partial | R61 F used memory as judgement input and not a fixed route. | Unavailable capabilities, fallback paths, and why worked/failed are not explicit enough. | no | Strengthen Routing Memory and Conductor Decision records; add failure example. | yes |
| E2E Synthesis Readability | partial | R61 H was readable, but synthesis templates are still YAML-first. | Users need a short summary before details. | no | Add user-facing short summary template and synthesis short-summary field. | yes |
| No-code Boundary | pass | R61 changed Markdown-only public artifacts and retained no-code language. | Public reports should keep partial/unavailable language visible as templates expand. | no | Add evals for no-code, unavailable, partial, and synthesis readability. | yes |

## R61 Proved

R61 proved that a current host Runtime can manually follow Deep Conductor no-code packages and return evidence for documentation, eval, and synthesis work.

## Still Protocol-Level

The following remain protocol-level unless a host Runtime performs the approved package and returns evidence:

- Runtime Skill execution quality;
- source freshness and render verification for research-to-artifact work;
- release publishing;
- cross-runtime memory freshness;
- parallel review isolation enforcement;
- subagent / external Agent execution.

## R62 Repair Scope

R62 strengthens templates and evals so future packages:

- state execution feasibility;
- require runtime availability evidence;
- distinguish pass, partial, unavailable, blocked, not-run, and fail;
- provide fallback paths;
- produce concise user-facing synthesis;
- record unavailable capabilities in memory without making fixed routes.

## Boundary

This analysis contains no internal local paths, no private reports, and no host Runtime secrets. It does not claim that AgentPal auto-executes Deep Conductor or launches external Agents.
