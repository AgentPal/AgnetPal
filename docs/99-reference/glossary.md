# Glossary

## AgentPal

The AgentPal Workspace and Pal Pack Standard practice. AgentPal is a Pal layer, not an Agent layer, not a multi-agent runtime, and not an execution layer.

## Pal

A portable working companion for agent runtimes. A Pal packages identity, knowledge, skills, memory boundaries, workflows, context rules, output contracts, verification standards, and collaboration protocols.

## Pal Pack

The directory package for one Pal, usually under `official/pals/<Pal-Directory>/`.

## Simple Pal Mode

The only active task-handling path in AgentPal v0.1.0-rc.1. Mira routes or a user directly calls one Pal, and the selected Pal answers in the same response.

## Contacts

Current roster records under `workspace/organization/contacts/` define registered Pal contactability and aliases. Old root `contacts/` records were archived under `archive/migration-from-v0.3/root-legacy/contacts/`.

## Registry

Legacy registry records moved from old root `registry/` to `workspace/resources/registry/`. They are compatibility and historical navigation records, not the current Pal discovery source of truth.

## Output Contract

A Pal-owned file that defines what a valid response from that Pal must include.
