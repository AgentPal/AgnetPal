# Repository Map

This map explains the public AgentPal Workspace layout. It is a navigation aid, not permission to load the whole workspace into context.

## Root Files

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agentpal.json` | Machine-readable workspace metadata, version, runtime policy, bundled Pal list, and context strategy. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Runtime-facing workspace instructions for Codex, Claude Code, and other AGENTS-aware runtimes. |
| `PAL.md` | AgentPal Workspace identity. It is not Mira's personal identity file. |
| `SKILL.md` | Workspace-level Skill entry. It is not a single-purpose Skill. |
| `prompts/codex/initialize-agentpal-workspace.md` | Copyable initialization prompt for supported runtimes. |
| `RESOURCE_INDEX.md` | Root resource navigation and context-loading guide. |
| `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` | Maintainer checklist for public release validation. |
| `RELEASE_NOTES.md` | User-facing release notes. |
| `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` | Current third-party notice state and future maintenance policy. |

## Main Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `standards/capability-inventory/` | Capability profile standards, protocols, policies, and matrices. |
| `workspace/organization/capability-inventory/` | Current central organization capability inventory records and usage-memory placeholders. |
| `examples/capability-inventory/` | Public-safe capability profile examples. |
| `capabilities/` | Temporary compatibility pointer for legacy capability inventory paths. |
| `docs/` | Public documentation and reference material. |
| `evals/` | Self-tests and release checks. |
| `examples/` | Public-safe examples and failure examples. |
| `models/` | Temporary compatibility pointer for legacy model capability inventory paths. |
| `orchestration/` | Current protocols and clearly marked future-design material. |
| `official/pals/` | Official bundled Pal Pack pool. Each `official/pals/<Pal>/` directory is one Pal Pack. |
| `plugins/` | Temporary compatibility pointer for legacy plugin capability inventory paths. |
| `prompts/` | Copyable maintenance and setup prompts. |
| `runtime/` | Temporary compatibility pointer for legacy runtime capability inventory paths. |
| `templates/` | Reusable templates for bindings, Context Packets, task packages, and reports. |
| `workspace/organization/memory/` | Public-safe organization memory placeholders and examples; private memory must not be committed. |
| `workspace/resources/imports/` | Import staging placeholders; not ordinary task context. |
| `workspace/resources/response-fingerprints/` | Response fingerprint references for Pal-mode validation. |
| `workspace/resources/registry/` | Legacy registry records moved from root during R76; not a central Pal roster source. |
| `archive/migration-from-v0.3/root-legacy/` | Old root compatibility pointers moved during R76 and R77. |

## Pal Discovery Boundary

`workspace/organization/contacts/` is the source of truth for Pal discovery. Old root `contacts/` and `pals/` are archived under `archive/migration-from-v0.3/root-legacy/`; legacy registry records now live under `workspace/resources/registry/`.

Skills, tools, plugins, models, MCP servers, raw repositories, runtime adapters, and knowledge packs do not become Pals because they are indexed. Only valid Pal Packs should enter contacts.
