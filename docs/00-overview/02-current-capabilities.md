# Current Capabilities

This page describes what AgentPal v0.3.0-rc.1 can do today without treating host-runtime-dependent or future runtime behavior as active AgentPal execution.

## Workspace Capabilities

- Provide an AgentPal Workspace with runtime-readable Markdown / JSON / protocol assets.
- Organize official and user-added Pal Packs under `official/pals/` or another organization-approved Pal asset area.
- Expose Pal discovery through `workspace/organization/contacts/`, with old root `contacts/` archived under `archive/migration-from-v0.3/root-legacy/contacts/` and legacy registry records under `workspace/resources/registry/`.
- Define runtime-facing release assets such as `AGENTS.md`, `PAL.md`, `SKILL.md`, `agentpal.json`, and the Codex initialization prompt at `prompts/codex/initialize-agentpal-workspace.md`.

## Pal Interaction Capabilities

- Start ordinary messages with Mira.
- Support `/pal Name` for explicit specialist calls.
- Support same-response owner handoff in `Simple Pal Mode`.
- Keep specialist Pals inactive until Mira routes or the user calls them directly.

## Context And Coordination Capabilities

- Fast Route for clear owner selection.
- Task Package for bounded task handoff.
- Context Slicing so runtimes load only relevant files.
- Asset Loading Budget so a Pal does not preload the whole workspace by default.
- Runtime Response Gate for answer validity and routing boundary.
- Deep Conductor as no-code protocols, task packages, examples, evals, synthesis reports, and replay reports.
- Context Packet, Owner + Verifier, Parallel Independent Review, Project Conductor, Cross-Runtime Pal Memory, Runtime-installed Skill Orchestration, and qualitative Context Budget guidance.

## Runtime Use Capabilities

- Codex quick-start path from the AgentPal Workspace.
- Claude Code project-first binding path with `.agentpal/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- Generic CLI agent compatibility path through `.agentpal/` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Validation And Release Capabilities

- Release notes, release checklist, and GitHub release draft files.
- PalBench Collaboration qualitative regression coverage with 87 cases.
- Public-safe prompts, examples, and evaluation assets.
