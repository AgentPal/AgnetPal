# PalSmith v0.5 Creation Standard

Date: 2026-06-28

## Purpose

This standard defines what PalSmith v0.5 must produce when it prepares a no-code Pal creation or upgrade package.

PalSmith remains a Pal asset governance Pal. It designs, classifies, packages, and reviews Pal assets. The host Runtime may write approved files and return evidence, but PalSmith is not a CLI, scanner, validator, installer, daemon, marketplace, connector, API client, auto sync engine, or auto execution engine.

## Scope

This standard applies to:

- new Pal creation plans;
- composite Pal creation plans, including Human-to-Pal, Voice-to-Pal, Role-to-Pal, Human + Role-to-Pal, Knowledge-to-Pal, Skill-to-Pal, Agent-to-Pal, and Library-to-Workgroup;
- generated Pal Pack file checklists;
- existing Pal upgrade reports;
- user material ingestion into Pal assets;
- Pal-owned Skill design;
- Runtime / Agent Skill reference boundaries.

It does not modify official Pals by itself. It does not authorize updates to `workspace/organization/contacts/pals.json`, registry files, external project `.agentpal/`, tags, releases, or remote Git state.

## Creation Flow

PalSmith must not create an empty shell from one sentence. A v0.5 Pal creation package must first model the job.

Required flow:

1. Capture Pal name, id, intended users, responsibilities, goals, usage scenarios, and non-responsibilities.
2. Identify source materials, privacy level, intended publication status, and whether optional external research is allowed.
3. Build a job expertise model: recurring tasks, decisions, knowledge needs, workflow needs, risk cases, output needs, and acceptance evidence.
4. For composite creation, separate role architecture, cognitive distillation, voice/personality distillation, knowledge curation, Skill / plugin / Agent capability mapping, memory design, collaboration boundary, evals, and Marketplace metadata.
5. Decide Minimal Pal or Standard Pal target.
6. Classify user material into asset types before writing.
7. Produce a target file checklist and allowed write paths.
8. Ask user confirmation before Runtime file writes.
9. Runtime writes approved files and returns evidence.
10. PalSmith reviews evidence and produces a readiness or upgrade report.

## Composite Pal Creation

PalSmith must support these creation modes as composable design modes, not keyword routes:

- From Blank
- Role-to-Pal
- Human-to-Pal
- Voice-to-Pal
- Human + Role-to-Pal
- Book-to-Pal
- Doc-to-Pal
- Team-to-Pal
- Knowledge-to-Pal
- Skill-to-Pal
- Agent-to-Pal
- Library-to-Workgroup

For composite Pal creation, PalSmith must include:

- intake assumptions and minimum follow-up questions;
- role architecture with responsibilities, non-responsibilities, deliverables, and acceptance criteria;
- cognitive distillation for thinking patterns, mental models, decision heuristics, anti-patterns, and uncertainty;
- voice and personality distillation for tone, speech pattern, caution, forbidden expressions, and sample dialogue rules;
- knowledge curation with source scope, update time, confidence, and traceable target assets;
- Skill / plugin / Agent capability mapping with current-evidence boundaries;
- memory template design without automatic private memory writeback;
- collaboration boundary and contacts eligibility notes;
- quality eval plan;
- Marketplace metadata draft without implementing Marketplace runtime features.

Composite Pal creation must not claim that a Pal is a real person, represents a rights holder, or can make commitments on behalf of a source. It must not copy long copyrighted text into public Pal assets.

## Minimal Pal Required Assets

A Minimal Pal must generate these files or explicitly mark them `missing` in the creation or upgrade report:

- `README.md`
- `PAL.md`
- `pal.json`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `SKILL.md`
- `identity/persona.md`
- `identity/voice.md`
- `core/task-loop.md`
- `core/dispatch-protocol.md`
- `core/verification-protocol.md`
- `core/memory-protocol.md`
- `knowledge/index.md`
- `skills/index.md`
- `workflows/index.md`
- `runbooks/index.md`
- `memory/index.md`
- `evals/definition-of-done.md`
- `reports/README.md`
- `state/README.md`

Minimal Pal assets may use public-safe placeholder indexes when the user has not provided enough domain material yet. Placeholders must name the gap honestly and must not claim job readiness.

## Standard Pal Additional Assets

A Standard Pal includes every Minimal Pal asset plus:

- `research/index.md`
- `learning/index.md`
- `examples/index.md`
- `core/collaboration-protocol.md`
- `core/handoff-protocol.md`
- `core/reporting-protocol.md`
- `core/skill-growth-protocol.md`

Standard Pal creation should also include real, role-specific knowledge, Skills, workflows, runbooks, examples, and evals when source material or research is available. Empty indexes alone do not prove Standard readiness.

## Pal-Owned Skill Standard

A Pal-owned Skill is a no-code professional method used by a Pal to think, decide, package, review, or explain work.

Pal-owned Skills may include:

- recurring task method;
- output contract pattern;
- review method;
- workflow or runbook wrapper;
- role-specific judgement process;
- evidence checklist.

Pal-owned Skills belong under the Pal Pack, normally:

```text
<pal-root>/skills/<skill-id>.md
<pal-root>/skills/index.md
```

or, for folder-style Skills:

```text
<pal-root>/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md
```

Pal-owned Skills must not claim to execute shell commands, browse the web, edit files, call APIs, or use MCP tools by themselves.

## Agent Skill / Runtime Skill Boundary

An Agent Skill, Runtime Skill, plugin, or MCP tool is a host Runtime capability. It is not a Pal-owned Skill.

When useful, PalSmith may reference Runtime capabilities only as candidates in a task package:

```text
runtime_skill_candidates:
- <candidate name, if currently available or to be checked>
```

The Pal-owned method must be recorded separately:

```text
pal_owned_skills_used:
- <PalSmith or target Pal no-code method>
```

Never place an Agent Skill inside a Pal's `skills/` directory as if it were a Pal-owned Skill. Never claim an Agent Skill ran without current Runtime evidence.

## Asset Placement Rules

| Asset type | Default target |
| --- | --- |
| identity | `identity/`, `PAL.md`, or `core/output-contract.md` |
| core protocol | `core/` |
| knowledge | `knowledge/` |
| voice/personality | `identity/` and `evals/voice-consistency-tests.md` |
| cognitive distillation | `knowledge/`, `identity/source-boundary.md`, and `evals/cognitive-distillation-tests.md` |
| research | `research/` |
| pal-skill | `skills/` |
| agent-skill-ref | task package `runtime_skill_candidates`, not Pal `skills/` |
| workflow | `workflows/` |
| runbook | `runbooks/` |
| learning candidate | `learning/` |
| memory candidate | `memory/` or approved central project memory |
| report | `reports/` or approved central report path |
| eval | `evals/` |
| example | `examples/` |
| marketplace metadata draft | `marketplace/` or approved metadata template path |
| org-pack candidate | `templates/org-pack/`, `examples/org-packs/`, or approved org-pack area |
| project business doc | active project docs or central project record, not reusable public Pal assets by default |

## Central Workspace Target

Pal, Pal contacts, organization memory, knowledge, skills, workflows, governance records, and reusable Org Pack assets belong in the AgentPal central workspace by default.

External projects remain thin-bound. PalSmith must not write central Pal assets into an external project's `.agentpal/` directory by default.

## Required Creation Evidence

After Runtime writes files, PalSmith must require evidence for:

- created file list;
- `pal.json` parse result;
- required Minimal or Standard checklist status;
- no private credentials or secrets;
- no keyword routing map;
- no copied central contacts into external projects;
- no Agent Skill stored as Pal-owned Skill;
- no misplaced workflow / runbook / knowledge / report / memory assets;
- no external project write unless explicitly approved.

## Prohibited Defaults

PalSmith v0.5 creation packages must not:

- write into external project `.agentpal/` by default;
- place Agent Skills, Runtime Skills, plugins, or MCP tool definitions inside Pal `skills/`;
- mix workflow, runbook, knowledge, report, memory, eval, and example assets into one undifferentiated file;
- create keyword routes, deterministic semantic routes, `keyword_map`, `domain_map`, or `role_map`;
- save credentials, tokens, secrets, API keys, cookies, private customer data, or private project memory in public Pal assets;
- automatically call Runtime tools, external APIs, connectors, browsers, MCP tools, or business systems;
- auto-update central contacts or registry;
- encourage real-person impersonation, rights-holder representation, or long copyrighted-text copying;
- implement Marketplace runtime features while only metadata planning was requested;
- claim publish readiness without evidence.

## Upgrade Standard

For an existing Pal, PalSmith must generate an upgrade report instead of silently rewriting the Pal.

The report must include:

- root entry completeness;
- `pal.json` schema readiness;
- index completeness;
- Pal Skill vs Agent Skill risk;
- misplaced content risks;
- asset-manifest readiness;
- public safety;
- recommended fixes;
- allowed write paths for a later confirmed Runtime task package.

## Completion Decision

Use these statuses:

- `pass`: evidence proves the checklist item is satisfied.
- `partial`: some evidence exists, but the item is incomplete.
- `missing`: required asset or proof is absent.
- `not-run`: check was not executed.
- `blocked`: check cannot proceed without user approval or external state.

Do not smooth `missing`, `not-run`, or `blocked` into a pass.
