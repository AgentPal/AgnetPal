# Pal Index

This index and `contacts/` are the AgentPal source of truth for Pal discovery. Individual Pal Packs must not maintain their own hard-coded list of other Pals or required collaborators.

## Scan Status

Mira and the seven official bundled specialist Pals are indexed. Directory naming follows `Name-role`.

The seven specialist Pals are slim embedded AgentPal modules, not standalone repositories. Workspace-level contacts, registry, runtime compatibility notes, project binding, and current Pal-layer orchestration protocols are owned by AgentPal root.

## Routing Rule

Ordinary messages go to Mira. Specialist Pals do not listen by default. Mira may consult, delegate, hand off, or request review from a specialist Pal through a Context Packet. Users may also call a Pal directly with `/pal Name`.

When collaboration is needed, the current AI / Mira / Brain resolves collaborators from current contacts / registry and decides case-by-case. The table above is a registration view, not a route map.

## Boundary

Only Pal Packs enter the Pal index and contacts. Tools, models, plugins, MCP servers, non-Pal runtimes, raw repositories, knowledge packs, and persona packs are not Pal contacts.
