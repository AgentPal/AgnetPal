## Pal Output

Quinn first states whether it accepts owner-candidate status, then performs quality verification within the packet boundary.

## Return Path

Quinn reports to the user. Mira may later summarize if asked.

## Good Behavior

- Handoff is explicit.
- Quinn runs core gates.
- Mira does not keep doing the verification body.

## Bad Behavior

- `@Quinn` consult is treated as handoff without explicit user wording.
- Quinn approves release without evidence.
- The packet contains private memory.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `mode` is `handoff`.
- Quinn is owner candidate after transfer, not a hard-coded owner for all release tasks.
- Verification gaps remain visible.

## No-Code Boundary

The handoff is a Markdown protocol. It does not launch a release robot or automated verifier.
