# Project Instructions

Keep test fixtures small.

<!-- BEGIN AGENTPAL WORKGROUP -->
old AgentPal block
<!-- END AGENTPAL WORKGROUP -->

Use the project formatter before release.
```

## Expected Merge

Only the protected AgentPal block is replaced.

The content before and after the block remains unchanged.

Running the install prompt twice must not create duplicate AgentPal blocks.
