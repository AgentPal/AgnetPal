# Content Ops With Accounting Advisor Combined Pack

This is a public-safe combined Org Pack + FDE Pack example for AgentPal v0.5.

It shows how a reusable content operations Org Pack can reference a reusable
accounting advisor FDE Pack without copying customer-private evidence, Pal
bodies, central contacts, connector settings, credentials, marketplace logic,
scanner logic, validator programs, or keyword routing into the combined pack.

## How To Read This Example

- Start with `usage-walkthrough.md` for the combined Org Pack + FDE Pack flow.
- Use `project-binding-walkthrough.md` to keep external project bindings thin.
- Use `central-project-record-walkthrough.md` to understand where private
  project records belong.

## Boundary

- This combined pack is no-code documentation and governance.
- The Org Pack reference provides reusable content operations structure.
- The FDE Pack reference provides reusable accounting advisor delivery assets.
- Recommended Pals are AI judgement inputs only.
- Customer-private accounting, tax, finance, content, and project evidence stays
  in approved private project records.
- External projects remain thin-bound and do not receive copied Org/FDE/Pals
  directories by default.
