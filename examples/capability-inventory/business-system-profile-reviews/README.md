# Business System Profile Review Examples

These examples show public-safe no-code review packets for possible organization-level Business System profile updates.

They are examples only. They do not update organization profiles, modify the central Pal roster, connect to external systems, store credentials, create connectors, run scanners, or write records into external project `.agentpal/` directories.

## Examples

| Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `notion-read-access-review.example.md` | Shows a blocked review packet where project usage memory suggests possible Notion read access but evidence remains missing. |
| `notion-read-access-manual-update-evidence.example.md` | Shows a public-safe manual update evidence pack premise after a review is approved, without actually updating the organization profile. |
| `notion-read-access-manual-writeback-replay.example.md` | Shows a public-safe replay record premise after a manual writeback, without executing writeback, rollback, or second verification. |
| `notion-read-access-audit-trail-index.example.md` | Shows a public-safe audit trail index across review, evidence, replay, rollback, and second verification records without executing actions. |
| `notion-read-access-governance-decision.example.md` | Shows a public-safe governance decision record that keeps manual update blocked while second verification evidence is missing. |

## Boundary

Project usage memory can propose a review. It cannot become organization truth by itself.

An approved review can lead to a manual update evidence pack. The evidence pack records confirmation, host Runtime evidence, rollback notes, and second verification status, but it still does not auto-update organization profiles, modify central contacts, create connectors, store credentials, keyword-route, or write into external project `.agentpal/evidence/`.

After a manual writeback has happened, a replay record can audit changed fields, rollback record, and second verification result. Replay records still do not execute writeback, auto-rollback, modify central contacts, create connectors, store credentials, keyword-route, or write into external project `.agentpal/replay/`, `.agentpal/rollback/`, or `.agentpal/verification/`.

When multiple related records exist, an audit trail index can summarize paths, statuses, risks, open unknowns, not-run checks, missing evidence, and next manual action suggestions. Audit trail indexes still do not execute actions, auto-call external APIs, auto-close missing evidence, modify central contacts, create connectors, store credentials, keyword-route, or write into external project `.agentpal/audit-trail/`.

After review, evidence, replay, and audit trail review, a governance decision record can capture the human decision. Governance decision records can allow a bounded manual profile update, reject it, block it for missing evidence, or require second verification, but they still do not execute writeback, auto-close missing evidence, modify central contacts, create connectors, store credentials, keyword-route, or write into external project `.agentpal/governance-decisions/`.
