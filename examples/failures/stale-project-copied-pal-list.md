# Failure Example: Stale Project-Copied Pal List

Failure shape:

```text
.agentpal/PAL_GROUP.md contains a copied list of Pals and says it is authoritative.
```

Why this fails:

- AgentPal contacts / registry are the Pal source of truth.
- A copied Pal list can become stale when a Pal is added, removed, renamed, or repaired.
- Direct `/pal Name` and owner judgement must resolve from the AgentPal workspace, not from a project-local roster copy.

Correct shape:

```text
.agentpal/PAL_GROUP.md says the roster is read from:
- agentpal_workspace_root/contacts/pals.json
- agentpal_workspace_root/registry/pal.index.json
```
